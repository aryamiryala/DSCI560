Model: PNY 5080

* Condition: refurbished! (More like replaced).

* I had this as my daily driver for a while but had a fan go out. Sent it to pny to get repaired more than a month ago. Received it today it looks like they just replaced it instead. Has all the clear wrap on it (even on the fan hubs) which is removed on my original one. This one they sent is 100% functional and hit 8600 on Timespy out of the box with no voltage adjustment and +5% power limit. Runs super cool on furmark too, the fans did not need to kick up. Gotta give it to pny, their coolers are great. The downside it had coilwhine. So buy it expecting coil whine. I suspect they sent me a new one with coil whine as all the tamper stickers are still on and everything so eventually the whine should lessen. I asked and they won't replace the card for just coil whine.

* All sales final and the card is registered to me so any warranties will need to go through me, and as with any gpu I sell as long as you save your paypal invoice from me I will honor it right until it runs out (sbout 2.6 years left).

* I would keep it but I already have a white gpu that matches my build.


* Comes with the white refurbished box. Includes accessories (power adapter).

~~$1050 shipped. Paypal G/S invoice.~~ sold!

* bought this in the time I had no gpu and the 5080 above was on my daily rig but was out. Eventually I replaced it with a white 5080. 

* Perfect condition. No issues and no whine. Comes with original PNY box.

* As usual any gpu warranties I will assist until it runs out.

----------

I'm looking to sell my gaming PCs to make ends meet as I can no longer reconcile ""I don't have time to play games anymore"" with ""I have too many expensive gaming PCs."" All my PCs are tuned for low noise and are regularly cleaned. These PCs have a ton of RAM, storage, and decent GPUs, but I was surprised even researching used prices for them; if they're too high, I do entertain offers.

**Monitor: MSI MAG 272QP X50** 500Hz 27"" 1440p QD-OLED monitor. I've owned it for just long enough for it to be past its return period. Extremely low hours - what gaming I am doing I'm doing on a PG38UQ, with this monitor sitting over on the ""friend desk"" and rarely even being powered on due to lack of LAN parties. There is an imperfection in the panel coating near the lower right corner of the panel that is visible when the screen is off and you are looking at it from an unusual angle, but it's not visible during use. Retail is anywhere between $700-750 plus tax, my asking is **$600** for it.

**~~Nvidia Inno3d 4070TI Super Twin X2~~**~~: I ran this in a Midori under-volted. This is a very uncommon gpu in the US since it wasn't sold here. It is the most powerful card that fits in a few SFF cases like the Midori 5l and Velka 5. (To my knowledge at least). Full disclaimer it is a little on the noisy side given its size and I do not have the box, but Includes the 2x8 pin to 12vhpr adapter. The last one sold on here a few months ago for $750. I am asking $700 shipped.~~ SOLD

**~~Colorful 4060 mini~~**~~: Also not sold in the US. Runs cool and quiet, no box. Asking $250 shipped~~ SOLD

Asking ~~$470~~ **$430** shipped to CONUS

Hello smart people, I've got another laptop for sale. This is in excellent shape with only a couple of light marks to the body. The Surface Studio Laptop is the unicorn from Microsoft that folds out to tablet or hybrid mode. This hinge is very stiff (in the good way) and works great, and the chassis is rigid and all-metal. Only 4 lbs.

The specs are below and it's quite fast, though not the greatest at CPU-heavy loads.

* 11th-gen i7 with 16gb RAM
* 512gb NVME
* RTX 3050 ti
* 1600p 120hz 500-nit touchscreen and very loud speakers
* Original 127w charger and a basic backpack (not pictured)

Everything functions well and it has a fresh install of Windows 11. Please comment below before you PM me. If you want to come to Cincy for a cash local pick-up, we can discuss an appropriate discount.",,"laptop,only,very,below,asking",Asking 470 430 shipped to CONUS Hello smart people I ve got another laptop for sale This is in excellent shape with only a couple of light marks to the body The Surface Studio Laptop is the unicorn from Microsoft that folds out to tablet or hybrid mode This hinge is very stiff in the good way and works great and the chassis is rigid and all metal Only 4 lbs The specs are below and it s quite fast though not the greatest at CPU heavy loads 11th gen i7 with 16gb RAM 512gb NVME RTX 3050 ti 1600p 120hz 500 nit touchscreen and very loud speakers Original 127w charger and a basic backpack not pictured Everything functions well and it has a fresh install of Windows 11 Please comment below before you PM me If you want to come to Cincy for a cash local pick up we can discuss an appropriate discount,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/1r327xq/usaoh_h_microsoft_surface_studio_laptop_rtx_3050/,2026-02-12 23:49:33

1r35ico,hardwareswap,user_d4430a24c5ec,2026-02-12 21:07:38,"[JPN][H] PayPal [W] 8x DDR5 RDIMM ECC for WRX90 (96GB Hynix/Kingston/Micron, 128GB Samsung or 64GB Hynix)","Hello,

I am currently building a workstation based on the **ASUS Pro WS WRX90E-SAGE SE** (Threadripper 7000WX) and I am looking to fill all 8 memory slots.

I am looking for **8 matched sticks** of DDR5 RDIMM (ECC Registered) memory. I am specifically targeting SK Hynix M-die/A-die or Samsung server pulls.

I am located in **Japan**. I am expecting international shipping via DHL/FedEx/UPS.

# Open to Offers (QVL)

While I have a specific target list below, **I am open to ANY offer** that matches the [ASUS WRX90E-SAGE SE QVL](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/workstation/pro-ws-wrx90e-sage-se/helpdesk_qvl_memory?model2Name=Pro-WS-WRX90E-SAGE-SE). My preference order for capacity is: **96GB &gt; 128GB &gt; 64GB**.

# Pricing Expectations

I am aware that 96GB+ 5600 RDIMMs are high-value items, but please note that I am looking for **Used/OEM/Server Pull** pricing, not Retail. Since these modules (Hynix/Samsung OEM) do not carry a transferable consumer warranty and are likely ""tray"" or ""pull"" units, I expect offers to reflect the lack of manufacturer warranty. I am looking for a fair market deal for both sides.

# Priority Target List

I am looking for **Quantity: 8** of the following modules, ranked by preference:

**1. The ""Holy Grail"" (96GB Hynix M-Die)**

* **Specs:** 96GB DDR5-5600 ECC RDIMM (Hynix M-Die)
* **Target Part Numbers:**
   * **SK Hynix:** `HMCGM4MGBRB244N`
   * **SK Hynix:** `HMCGM4MHBRB`
   * **Kingston:** `KSM56R46BD4PMI-96HMI`
* *Reason:* These are my absolute top choices due to the Hynix M-die density and performance.

**2. The 96GB Alternatives (Micron/Kingston)**

* **Specs:** 96GB DDR5-5600 ECC RDIMM
* **Target Part Numbers:**
   * **Kingston:** `KSM56R46BD4PMI-96MBI`
   * **Micron:** `MTC40F204WS1RC56BB1`
* *Reason:* Excellent alternatives if the Hynix M-die modules are unavailable.

**3. The Capacity Choice (128GB Samsung)**

* **Target Part Number:** `M321RAGA0B20-CWK`
* **Specs:** Samsung 128GB DDR5-4800 4Rx4
* *Reason:* Specifically looking for the ""CWK"" (4800) variant. I am avoiding the overpriced ""CWM"" (5600) variant unless the price is highly competitive.

**4. The High Speed Alternative (64GB Hynix)**

* **Target Part Number:** `HMCG94AGBRA182N` (or `177N`)
* **Specs:** SK Hynix 64GB DDR5-5600 2Rx4
* *Reason:* A solid alternative to the 4800 kit if the price is close.

**5. The Best Value Choice (64GB Hynix)**

* **Target Part Number:** `HMCG94MEBRA121N` (or `109N`)
* **Specs:** SK Hynix 64GB DDR5-4800 2Rx4
* *Reason:* The most reliable budget option for this platform.

**6. The Samsung Alternative (64GB Samsung)**

* **Target Part Number:** `M321R8GA0BB0-CQK`
* **Specs:** Samsung 64GB DDR5-4800 2Rx4
* *Reason:* A viable alternative if you have a full matched set of 8.

# Requirements:

* **Quantity:** Must be a matched set of 8 (or two sets of 4 with identical P/N).
* **Condition:** New, Open Box, or Clean Server Pulls.
* **Labels:** Must have original manufacturer labels intact.
* **No ES/QS:** I cannot risk stability on this build. Retail/OEM production units only.

# Payment &amp; Shipping:

* Payment via **PayPal Goods &amp; Services** (Invoice).
* Please quote shipping to **Chiba, Japan** (I can provide exact address in PM).

I disassembled my Dad's old computer he gave to me and found some gems inside.  I honestly had no clue this was what he was running.  I don't know if anybody still collects older retro stuff anymore, but if so these are pristine working parts.

Motherboard: Biostar TA790GX AM2+

CPU: AMD Athlon X2 6000+

Ram: 4x 2gb Corsair XMS2 DDR2 800mhz

GPU: Asus Geforce 9800GTX+ Dark Knight

PSU: OCZ 600W (Looks brand new, no dust inside at all)

I don't really know what to price these at, ebay shows some stuff sold recently so I'll go $150 for all of it plus shipping.  Even have a windows 7 home dvd I'll throw in with it unless you'd rather run XP.  CMOS battery does seem to be dead, I don't have any 2032 batterys laying around.  Feel free to ask any questions and make an offer.  I would prefer to sell it all together.

Hello everyone,

I recently started gathering parts for a secondary build/upgrade, but plans have changed, and I'm parting out. Some of the parts have already gone to my son's PC, so if it's not listed, then it's not for sale.

Most of these components are practically new. The GPU is barely a month old, the motherboard is literally brand new in the box, and the other parts have very low hours. I can provide original receipts for any items upon request. I'd prefer to sell in one big lot, but I can part out as well.

**Bundle Price: $1,450 (OBO) + We Split Shipping**

Local is 97333, happy to meet up for a cash deal.
