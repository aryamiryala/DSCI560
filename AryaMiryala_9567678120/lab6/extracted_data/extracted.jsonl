The original Basic Game & Fish\n34-3 was drilled directionally (due to surface restrictions on the Missouri River\nfloodplain) by Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. in late 1985, reaching total depth in the\nMission Canyon Formation (Mississippian in age), below the Nesson zone. A string of\n5.5\" production casing was run to total depth after electric logging, and the Nesson zone\nwas perforated and completed.\nThe original Game & Fish 34-3 was completed for 98 BOPD, 0 BWPD and 64\nMCF gas per day. More recently, Nance Petroleum Corp acquired the well. Recent\nproduction from the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 was 23 BOPD and 6 BWPD. The well has\nproduced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG and 6,623 BW through mid 2002.\nNance re-entered the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 and milled a window for\nsidetracking operations in November 2002. The horizontal leg is refrred to as 34-3H,\nThe four primary offset wells used for correlation while drilling the Basic Game &\nFish 34-3H are:\n1) the original open hole logs from the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.\nBasic Game & Fish 34-3 (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.), with\nthe surface location 392' FSL & 494\u2019 FWL in the SW SW Section 2,\nT153N, R101W, Mckenzie Co., N_D.\n2) the John 1. Cox (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.) French-\nPinney #24-3, located 660\u2019 FSL & 1,955\u2019 FWL in the SE SW Section 3,\nT153N, RIO1W, McKenzie Co.,N.D. The French-Pinney was drilled\nin 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation (Ordovician in age).\nThe French-Pinney IP\u2019d for 276 BOPD, 486 MCFG, and 0 BWPD, and\nhas produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456 MCFG, and 193,009 BW.\n3) the Nance Petroleum Corp. M&G #14-2 (originally drilled by John L.\nCox in 1987 as the Basic Game & Fish #14-2). The M&G surface\nlocation is on the same pad as the Basic Game & Fish 34-3, spotted at\n559\u2019 FSL & 573\u2019 FWL in the SW SW Section 2, T153N, R101W,\nRh cPOLOCY SERVICE\nSidetrack #1 was initiated at 9,460\u2019 MD off of Lateral #1. Sidetrack #1\nproceeded in zone, in the upper Nesson porosity, until drilling out of the top of the target\naround 11,620\u2019 MD. The decision was made to pull back and sidetrack \u201cin zone\u201d, rather\nthe waste the time and footage to drill back down to the target. Part of the difficulty with\nrecovering from drilling out the top of the Nesson is the poor \u201cdrill-ability\u2019 of the overlying\nbasal Midale argillaceous marker. \u201cSliding\u201d (or directionally orienting the well path)\nbecomes very slow and unproductive. Steering is much more effective within the\nNesson porosity itself. The Sidetrack #1 was terminated at 11,680\u2019 MD, at a position of\n970.22\u2019 North & 3,406.95\u2019 West of the surface location. This calculates to a point\napproximately 1,362\u2019 FSL & 2,371\u2019 FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.\nSidetrack #2 was initiated around 11,400\u2019 MD off of Sidetrack #1. Sidetrack #2\nproceeded \u201cin zone\u2019 in the Nesson porosity, but initially at a deeper stratigraphic horizon\nthan Sidetrack #1. The early portion of Sidetrack #2 explored the lower 10\u00b0 of the 15\u00b0\ngross Nesson porosity. A trip for a new bit was made at 12,040\u00b0 MD in Sidetrack #2.\nDrilling of Sidetrack #2 proceeded after the bit trip mostly in the upper Nesson porosity\nuntil several factors necessitated the termination of the drilling, These factors included\nthe approaching legal \u201chardline setback\u2019, dead MWD batteries and the penetration of\nthe top the Nesson into the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker. Sidetrack #2\nreached total depth at 12,800' MD. The Bottom Hole Location [BHL] at total depth in\nSidetrack #2 was 1,582.72\u2019 North & 4,338.8\u2019 West of the surface location, at\napproximately 1,975' FSL & 1,439' FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.\nRe-entry and horizontal drilling of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H took 21 days\nand ~206 rotating hours. A total of 3,986.35 barrels of water were lost during drilling.\nThe Nesson laterals were left uncased for an acid stimulation and horizontal completion,\nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION\nThe geologic evaluation of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began at the window\nmilling operation, stratigraphically above the top of the Ratcliffe member of the Charles\nFormation (Mississippian in age), at 9,038\u2019 MD. Sunburst Consulting provided well site\ngeologists and a digital data gathering system. The digital gas information was\naugmented by the use of a digital gas chromatograph. Drilling rig data (including ROP\n[Rate of Penetration], on-off bottom status, and mud pump strokes) was received\nthrough a digital connection to the rig EOR [Electronic Data Recorder], The Sunburst\ngas detection readings were returned for display and monitoring to the rig EDR.\nEngineering and geologic data were then compiled and distributed on a digital drafting\nand Internet communications system.\nBUILD CURVE & LATERAL\nAfter milling the window in the pre-existing 5.5\" casing the directional portion of\nthe Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began. The KOP for the lateral was at 9,038' MD, just\nabove the top of the Ratcliffe zone of the iower Charles Formation (below the Base Last\nSalt).\nNBUR\n|\na a\nThe Ratcliffe was encountered at 9,078' MD, 8,970' TVD, (-7107'). There was a\nsignificant hydrocarbon show identified within the Ratcliffe interval between 9,114\u2019 and\n9,124\u2019 MD. Gas peaked at 243 units [1% methane in air = 100 units] with large \u201cheavy\ngas\u201d components (C3\u2019s & C4s). Elevated backgound gas levels and large connection\nand downtime gas spikes were recorded for the balance of the drilling of the Basic\nGame & Fish #34-3H that are attributed (at least in part) to this zone. Samples\nrecovered from this Ratcliffe show interval included Limestone: light to occasional\nmedium brown, tan, very fine crystalline, occasional peioidal, occasional spotty black oil\nstain, dull green fluorescence, slow streaming cut in part, poor to very poor\nintercrystalline and interparticle porosity, occasionally anhydritic. These shows were\nconsidered exceptional for the Ratcliffe interval in this area, and warrant further\ninvestigation.\nThe Midale interval (also a member of the Charles Formation) was topped at\n9,189\u2019 MD, 9,056' TVD, (-7193'). There were only trace sample shows observed within\nthe Midale, with no significant gas increases over the high Ratcliffe background.\nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation (Nesson zone) was reached at 9,350'\nMD, 9,127.9' TVD (-7264.9') in the curve building portion of the lateral. Samples from\nthe initial contact with the Nesson porosity contained Limestone: tan, cream, very fine\ncrystalline, fragmental, occasionally peloidal, spotty black oil stain in vugs, yellow\nfluorescence in part, slow streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and small pin\npoint vuggy porosity, occasional white to clear anhydrite & calcite crystals. Surface oil\n(free oil on the samples) was observed, probably coming from produced oil in the drilling\nfluid (mud). A trip gas spike of 1,802 units was recorded when the steerable assembly\nwas tripped into the hole at 9,475' MD, Due to an unexpectedly aggressive angle build\nin the last portion of the curve build, the top of the Nesson was once again encountered\nat 9,521\" MD, 9,127\u2019 TVD as the well path moved back up stratigraphically.\nSIDETRACK #1\nSidetrack #1 was initiated to avoid the sharp upward climb of the end of Lateral\n#1, Sidetrack #1 remained predominately within the top 5\u2019 of the Nesson porosity, and\noscillating between the top of the Nesson and the relative \u201chard streak\u201d delineating the\nbase of the uppermost 3.5\u2019 to 8\u2019 (stratigraphically) of the Nesson porosity. The well path\ndid traverse up into the base of the Midale on two occasions, but it was possible to steer\nback down into the targeted Nesson porosity. A tabulation of the encounters with the\ntop of the Nesson / base of the Midale and with the \u201chard streak\u201d 3.5-5' dawn from the\ntop of the Nesson is presented in the table \u201cDip Estimates\u201d. Some of the recorded\nevents are based on Gamma Ray markers, while others (generally the \u201chard streak\u201d)\nare interpreted from drill rate and natural inflections of the well path. Samples from the\nupper Nesson porosity were generally limestone: tan, cream, very fine crystalline,\nfragmental, occasional peloidal, spotty black oil stain in vugs, yellow fluorescence, slow\nto fast streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and pin point vuggy porosity, with\nsome white to clear anhydrite and calcite crystals.\nNG\nCo\nOne portion of Sidetrack #1 that exhibited higher gas readings was noted\nbetween 11,315\u2019 MD and 11,355\u2019 MD. Drillers noted torque and bit bound around\n411,370\u2019 MD that may indicate a fractured interval. Gas background levels and the size\nof the connection gas and downtime gas spikes was greater following the events at\n11,315\u2019 MD to 11,355\u2019 MD and 11,370\u2019 MD. Sidetrack #1 was terminated when the\nbase of the Midale argillaceous zone was penetrated at a steep up angle.\nSIDETRACK #2\nSidetrack #2 was started off of Sidetrack #1 to avoid the encounter with the\n\u201ctough drilling\" basal Midale. Sidetrack #2 took off from Sidetrack #1 below the 3.5' to 5\u00b0\n\u201chard streak\u201d and the first portion of Sidetrack #2 was drilled in the lower 10\u00b0 to 12'\nstratigraphically of the Nesson porosity. Gas readings were generally higher up to\n41,700' MD than the balance of the drilling of Sidetrack #2. This would seern to indicate\nthat the shows were better in the lower portion of the Nesson porosity as we reached\nout beyond 3,500\u2019 Vertical Section [VS] from the surface location. After tripping for a\nfresh bit at 12,040\u2019 MD, the well path was returned to the uppermost 3.5\u2019 to 5\u2019 of the\nNesson. Free oil was noted coming over the shale shaker screens following the bit trip\n(associated with the trip gas). Samples recovered from Sidetrack #2 were generally\nsimilar to those described above for Sidetrack #1, but becoming progressively smailler in\nsize (milled up by the drill pipe while passing through the lateral portion of the hole) and\nincreasingly coated with free oil from the mud system. Some samples were little more\nthan an oily paste, In Sidetrack #2, one short excursion into the overlying basal Midale\nwas experienced and another close encounter (without drilling all the way out of the\nNesson) was likely. Gas readings did depress somewhat with these \u201cout of porosity\u201d\nencounters, Interpreted and Gamma Ray - documented top and bottom of zone events\nare included in this report in a table that addresses \u201cDip Estimates\u201d.\nSidetrack #2 was terminated when the legal \u201chardline setback\u201d was approached, the\nMWD batteries failed, and the bagal Midale argillaceous marker was penetrated, all at\napproximately the same time.\nNE RS\nA\n__ BEGG\nz \u00ab\n)cr\nDIP ESTIMATES\nAverage formation dips were calculated using the multiple contact points with\nknown (or suspected) equivalent stratigraphic markers. The estimates are \u201cstraight line\u201d\nextrapolations, but serve to give an approximate average dip.

The lateral exposed\na net 3,800! foliowing the initial penetrations of the top of the Nesson. The vast majority\nlateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson, in or stratigraphically near\nthe Nesson \u201cporosity\u201d. The Basic Game & Fish #34-3H required 21 drilling days or\napproximately 206 drilling hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with\nfew delays or problems. General sample quality (e.g. How representative were the\nsamples recovered ?} was rated as fair to poor due to very fine cuttings size out in the\nlateral. The show quality in the lateral was fair to good, with obvious oil staining and\nvisible open porosity.\nCONCLUSIONS\n4) A window was milled in the original 5.5\" casing for directional sidetracking.\n2) A significant show was encountered in the Ratcliffe, which persistently\nproduced gas during the drilling of the weil,\n3) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H was successfully steered to a\nhorizontal trajectory in the targeted Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon\nFormation. Two open hole sidetracks were performed to keep the well\npath in the target zone,\n4) There were 3,800' measured depth feet drilled in the lateral following the\ninitial penetration of the Nesson. Of the total footage drilled after initial\npenetration of the Nesson target 3,249\u2019 (or 85.5%) were drilled in or very\nnear the targeted porosity streak, 68\u2019 (or1.8%) were drilled just below the\ntarget streak, and 483\u2019 (or 12.7%) were drilled just above the ideal target.\n5) Sample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair to good\nhydrocarbon production potential for the lateral, Fluid losses and free oil\nin the mud and on the samples also indicate permeability and movable oil\nphase.\n6) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H awaits open hole completion in the\nNesson lateral following an acid stirnulatian with the drilling rig after TD.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWayne Precraty\nSunburst Consulting\nWELL DATA SUMMARY\nOPERATOR: Nance Petroleum Corporation\nADDRESS: P.O.

The workover project was completed on September 16, 1997 and\nmeets the requirements set forth in North Dakota Century Code Section\n57-51.1-03.\nThe workover project was performed from September 9, 1997 to\nSeptember 16, 1997. The total cost of the project was $29,075. The\naverage daily production prior to commencement of the workover project from\nDecember 1996 through May 1997 was 23.5 barrels of oil per day. The\naverage daily production during the first sixty days after completion of the\nworkover project was 38.7 barrels of ofl per day.\nTherefore, it is determined the above listed well qualifies as a\nworkover project for tax exemption purposes. The Commission shall have\ncontinuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the matter.\nThe determination may be amended or rescinded by the Commission for good\ncause.\nSincerely,\nKent Fetzer\nPetroleum Engineer\nKF/dh\nec: Tax Dept.\n600 EAST BOULEVARD, BISMARCK.NORTH DAKOTA 58505 PHONE(701}328-8020 FAX (701)328-8022\ne=n SUNDRY NOTIC \u2018AND REPORTS ON WELLS - FORM Well Fie Number\ni INDUSTRIAL COMWNiSION OF NORTH DAKOTA 11745\nOIL AND GAS OVISION\nSFN 5749 (1-84) 800 East Boulevard\n@ismarck, ND SB505\nPLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS ON RACK OF FOAM\n\u00a381998 C-Spill Report\nO Notice of Intent\nOl Reatilling dXRepair #774404 Shooting\nApproximate Start Date\n0 Casing or Ae, Oh Acidizing\nO DReaptao rWt oarf kW Cork oDmpoletend O \u00a9 D e S P u lu p g p W iem ent e >ay g l iy h l ISI O a a R a i Q u \u2018fl c h Fr a a n ct g u e re P T r r o e d a u tm cin e g n t Method\n\u2014\u2014___\u2014_\u2014_\u2014__ O Temporarily Abandgz22\\i2-\"D Reclamation\n@ Othe _Workover Exemption\n24 HOUR PRODUCTION RATE\nWelt Name and Number\nBEFORE AFTER\nBasic Game Fish 34-3 cory on\nFootages Gigi Seguon | Township | Range\nSurface 392\u2019 Fst & 494' FWL| SWwSW 2 153N LOlwW] [Water Warar\nFrald Fool County\nBakex, Madison Mekenzie Gas Gas\nNate of Ganmraator\n\u2018Addewws iy Siac Sip Cade\nDETAILS OF WORK\nAPPLICATION FOR WORKOVER PROJECT DETERMINATION (43-02-09-04)\n.

The entire second flow was restricted,\nmaking the fluid recovery and reported gas flow rate low, With the\ninformation available, it is impossible to pinpoint the true flov\nrate, permeability, or gas-oi] ratio. It is quite possible that this\ntest could have flowed to surface. The skin factor and damage ratio\nnumbers are high due to tool restriction and do not suggest any\nsignificant well-bore damage was present at the time of this test.\nIf you should have any questions concerning this test, please do not\nhesitate to call, We appreciate your work and look forward to serving\nyou again.\nR.C.

The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional\nflooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. I urge you to closely monitor\nthese sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage\nif these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National\nWeather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area:\n600 E Boulevard Ave -Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022\nFrom: Allen Schlag [mailto:allen.schlag@noaa.gov]\nSent: Monday, May 12, 2014 1:47 PM\nTo: WILLIAMS; Samuelson, Jerry O.; MCKENZIE; Anton, Amy J.; Ackerman, Laura C.; Engelhardt, Bruce\nW.; Travnicek, Andrea J.; Johnson, Sean M.\nSubject: Missouri River\nGreetings everyone\nJust a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as\nwe go forward into latter half of May and early June {by default this also includes the Yellowstone in\nND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into\nForecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While\nthe Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River\noverall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into\nthe Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us.\nWe will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of\nWilliston at some point in the next couple of weeks.\nWhat exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the\noverall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However. .. there has been\na fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper\nelevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack,\nbut is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time {see the second attached pdf).\nIf I had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is\nreasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range.\nHow exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which I\ndon't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, I think there's a pretty decent chance that we\nwill see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone\nand Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June.\nHistorically, I know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with\nwater levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by\nring dikes or road raises, again ... very good question to which I have no answer.\nOf course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free\nto give me a call.\nAllen\np.s. And as always, feel free to disseminate as you feel is appropriate.\nAllen J. Schlag Service Hydrologist\nWFO-Bismarck\nNational Weather Service\n2301 Univ.

The workover project was completed\non June 20, 1994 and meets the requirements set forth in North\nDakota Century Code Section 57-51.1-03.\nThe workover project was performed from June 13, 1994 to June 20,\n1994. The total cost of the project was $39,239. The average\ndaily production from the well prior to commencement of the\nworkover project from December 1993 through May 1994 was 24.53\nbarrels of oil per day. The average daily production from the well\nduring the first sixty days after completion of the project was\n72.37 barrels of oil per day.\nTherefore, it is determined the above listed well qualifies as a\nworkover project for tax exemption purposes.\nThe Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have\nthe authority to review the matter. The determination may be\namended or rescinded by the Commission for good cause.\nSincerely,\nKent a\nPetroleum Engineer\ncc: Tax Dept\n600 EAST BOULEVARD, BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA S8505 PHONE (701) 224 2969 FAX (701) 224 3682\na,\nSQ SUNDRY NOTICES AND REPORTS ON WELLS - FORM\u20194. 9\na INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF NORTH DAKOTA\nOIL AND GAS DIVISION Wal fie Namba?\nSFN 5749 (2-92)\nf 11920\nPLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS ON BACK OF FORM\n\u00a9 Drilling Prognosis\nCG Notica of Intent\nC1 Redrilling or Repair _ ooting\nApproximate Start Date\n\u00a9 Casing ar Liner C1 Acidizing\nCO Plug Well C1 Fracture Treatment\n28 Report of Work Done\nO Supplemental History 1 Change Producing Method\nDate Work Completed :\nCO Temporarily Abandon Q Rectamation\n& Other _ Workover Exempti\n24 HOUR PRODUCTION RATE\nWeil Name and Number BEFORE AFTER\nCorps of Engineers 31-10 \u2018OH il\nFootages: Grr-Otr Section [Township | Range 22.92 72.37\n660' FNL 2305' FEL NWNE 10 153N 10TW Waver Water\nField Book 7 Cou ;\n.

This is a sensitive area as far\nas the high water table, and the possible flooding of the Missouri River. We\nfelt this should have been a lined pit.

No cultural\nresources were found, and cultural clearance is recommended with no\nspecial stipulations.\nPROJECT LOCATION:\nAgency: Corp of Engineers, Riverdale\nUSGS Quad: Williston SW (7.5')\nWell Location: NW/NE (660 fnt, 2305 fel) Sec.10-T153N-R101W\nPublic Surface (5 acres surveyed)\nAccess Route: NW/NE Section 10\n(0.11 miles surveyed, public surface)\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction is planned on a well pad (est. 300 x\n350\u00b0) and an access road (about 600 feet long). The access road leaves\nthe bladed county road just to the north and runs south on the west side\nof an irrigation canal to the well location. The well pad and access\nroad are staked in a plowed field which is currently in stubble. This\nflat area has been diked and is a controlled farming portion of the\nwide Missouri River floodplain.\nPROJECT SETTING: The proposed wel! location is situated on the recent\nMissouri River floodplain, in a silty area currently in cultivation. A\nJarge major meander (now a large recreational lake} is just to the south-\neast, while the main Missouri River channel is to the north. Elevation\nof the well pad area is about 1850 feet.\nFILES SEARCH: The files of the North Dakota State Historical Society\nindicate that no previous surveys or cultural resources are known for\nthe project area. Previous surveys in adjacent and nearby areas include\nwell pad and access road surveys by Greer, a pipeline survey by Powers\nElevation, and seismograph line studies by the Corps of Engineers; all\nprevious studies have provided negative results. No subsurface monitor-\ning of construction to provide subsurface information has been reported\nin any surrounding or nearby areas.\nFIELD WORK: During the intensive cultural resource survey on 3/30/86 by\nJohn and Mavis Greer, the 5 acres surrounding the well pad were surveyed\nwith multiple transects with an average spacing of 70 feet. Ground\nvisibility was fair to poor, due to mostly dense stubble and grass cover.\nThe well location was staked.\nCULTURAL RESOURCES: No cultural resources have been reported from the\narea, and none were found during the present inspection. There were no\nsurface indications of buried cultural deposits within the project area.\nTwo small shovel tests dug to 1.5 feet deep within the well pad planned\nconstruction area also yielded negative results.\nRECOMMENDATIONS: It appears that no cultural resources will be affected\nby the proposed project, and no further work is recommended. If subsur-\nface cultural materials are found during construction, the head of the\nfederal permitting agency should be notified immediately. These recom-\nmendations are subject to the approval of the permitting agency.\nATTACHMENTS: Project map (USGS quad).\nCOLLECTIONS: None.\nFigure 1, Portion of the Williston SW Quad (USGS 7.5'}, McKenzie County,\nNorth Dakota, showing the proposed Basic Corp of Engineers 31-10\nwell pad, access road, and 5-acre survey area.

We estimate a minimum delay of one\nmonth before construction of the drill pad can begin. Since the frost should\nno longer be a factor by that time, we believe a conventional drill pad would\nbe acceptable, therefore, permission is requested to deviate from the\nrequirement to cover the pad with plastic and build the location up with dirt\nacquired from a private source.\nThe Multi-Point Surface Use and Operation Plan should be amended as follows:\n4, Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities\nB. Exhibits 3 and 4 show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut\nand fill. These show that after removing six to elght inches of top\nsoil, the entire cut will be above 1850 feet. There should be\nsufficient dirt available from the drill pit and fill to level the\nlocation. All top soil and dirt removed during construction of the\nreserve pits will be placed in separate piles. Both piles will be\nkept as free as possible from contamination.\nc. Construction will be to strip the top soil and level the drilling\npad. The battery eosssese\n6. Source of Construction Materials\nAe sesaeethe Brush covering location will be scraped into a pile on\nthe southeast corner of the location. The top soll will be scraped\ninto a separate pile at the southwest corner of the location.

Due to lease constraints this well must be drilling by February\n1, 1986, and, therefore, your expeditious processing of this application is\nrequested.\nLIST OF EXHIBITS\nNumber Page\nTAT Regional Map 10\n1.2 Topographical Map - Access Roads 11\n2 Existing Well Plat 12\n3 Survey Plat 13\n4 Cut & Fill Cross Section a4\n5 Pit & Pad Layout 15\n6 Production & Equipment Layout 16\n7 Rig Layout 17\n8 Archeological Report 18\n9 BOP Diagram 19\n10 Well Control Equipment 20\nW ND Application for Permit to Drill at\n12 ND Game & Fish Surface Damage Agreement 22\n13 Drilling Prognosis 23\nle Existing Roads\nA. Directions to the location from Williston, North Dakota are as\nfollows: Go south on Highway 85 8-1/4 miles, turn east on first\nexisting gravel road with stop sign controlling access, proceed east\n2 miles, turn south on gravel road 460' to wellsite access.\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\nFor access roads in relation to county roads, see Exhibit 1.1 with\nthe access of U.S. 85 highlighted in pink. This map shows all\ncounty roads within a three mile radius\nExhibit 1.2 shows a detailed map of the existing roads. The first\ntwo miles of access off U.S. 85, marked in green, is a high quality\ngravel road. The following 460', marked in pink, is an existing\ngravel road with access onto the location.\nRoads within a one-mile radius are shown on Exhibit 1.1.\nExisting roads will be maintained as necessary to allow access\nduring drilling and completion operations.\n2. Planned Access Roads\nReferencing Exhibit 1.2 and the through segments of road:\nA. Prior to drilling, the existing roads will be upgraded as follows:\n(1) Gravel Road (Exhibit 1.2, green) This segment of road is in\ngood condition. Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. has recently\nupgraded this road in conjunction with other activity in this\narea and will continue to keep this road maintained.\n(2) Gravel Road (Exhibit 1.2, pink) This existing gravel road will\nrequire no improvement and will only require that the accesses\nto the location be built.\nIf the well is completed as a dry hole, the access will be\nreclaimed along with the rest of the location.\nIf the well is completed as a producer, the lease road will be\nupgraded as required and gravel added as needed.\nThe maximum grade will be less than six percent, however, this may\nvary as topographical conditions vary.\nNo turnouts are planned.\nNo culverts are planned.\nNative surfacing material from construction of access road will be\nsufficient for drilling. No outside construction materials are\nanticipated, if additional material is needed, then it will be\nacquired from a private source and it will be free of noxious weeds.\nNo gates, cattleguards or fence cuts will be necessary.\nNo road will be built. The location will be accessed from the\nexisting gravel road.\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\nLocation of Existing Wells Within One Mile Radius (see Exhibit 2)\nA. Water wells - 0\nB.

Other proposed locations - 1 (#14-2, SWASW} 2-153N-101W)\nLocation of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities\nA, Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. has production facilities on their\nRosebud #22-11 location approximately 4050 ft. to the southwest.\nThese consist of standard producing equipment for a Red River well.\nThe Basic Game & Fish #34-3 is being completed in the SWESWi Section\n2, Township 153 North, Range 101 West, and equipment will be\ninstalled for Mission Canyon production. Basic Earth Science\nSystems, Inc. has no other facilities in the area.\nExhibits 3 and 4 show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut\nand fill. Complying with the Corps of Engineers\u2019 requirement because\nof the frozen condition of the land, the wellsite will have the snow\nand vegetation bladed off down to the ground surface, a plastic\nliner laid on top and dirt added to level the location. The dirt\nwill be taken from the construction of the pit.\nNew facilities contemplated in the event of production are shown on\nExhibit 6.\n(1) Proposed tank battery and production equipment are as shown on\nExhibit 6 and are to be located adjacent to the existing road\nas shown on Exhibit 6. Said equipment will be bermed as per\nthe Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 requirement.\n(2) Dimension of the facilities are shown on Exhibit 6,\n(3) Construction will be to strip the topsoil, level drilling pad.\nThe battery site and treater pits will be constructed with soil\nmaterials native to the site. The additional material needed on\nsite will be acquired from a private source and will contain no\nnoxious weeds. Construction methods will be employed to assume\nthat no drainage Flows are impounded to prevent the loss of any\nhydrocarbon from the site. This is to be done in a manner to\nfacilitate rapid recovery and clean up. (See Exhibit 6).\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\n(4) Protective measures to protect wildlife and livestock will be\ntaken as follows: the weights on the pumping unit will be\nenclosed and the preduction pit will be fenced.\nUpon completion of well, areas required for continued use will be\ngraded to provide drainage and minimize erosion. Those areas\nunnecessary for use will be graded to blend with the surrounding\ntopography. Top-soil will be replaced on those areas and seeded\nwith Brome grass or other mixture as required by the Corps of\nEngineers and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department.\nLocation and Type of Water Supply\nA. Fresh water for spudding and drilling the first 6500 feet will be\ntrucked to location over the roads shown on Exhibit 1.2. Salt water\nfor the salt-saturated mud system will be trucked from Williston.\nSalt and fresh water will be trucked to location over the roads\nmarked on Exhibit 1.2.\nc. No water well is to be drilled on this lease.\nSource of Construction Materials\nA. Exhibit 5 shows the layout of the planned pad for drilling purposes.\nThis layout represents the maximum area to be disturbed. If a\nsmaller drilling rig is available, the actual size of the location\nwill be reduced to minimize the area disturbed. Prior to leveling\noff the drilisite pad, the brush covering location will be scraped\ninto a pile on the southeast corner of the location. A sheet of\nplastic will be laid over the wellsite. Dirt removed from the pit\nwill be distributed on the plastic. The site will then be leveled\nand laid out as shown on Exhibit 5. If the well is productive, the\ndrillsite will be reclaimed and an area sufficient for the wellhead\nand a completion rig will be left at the proposed drillsite. The\nproduction equipment will then be installed as shown in Exhibit 6 .\nSaid production equipment and wellhead will be diked as required by\nthe Corps of Engineers. Gravel will then be placed on the\nproduction pad. Construction materials will consist of soil\nencountered within the boundaries of the proposed site. Gravel will\nbe used, as needed. The entire producing facility will be fenced\nwith a two strand barbless wire fence.\nThe planned site and access roads are outleased to the North Dakota\nGame and Fish Department.\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\nCc. All gravel (containing no noxious weeds) will be obtained fron\nprivate land in quantities necessary for the access surfacing and\ntank base material on the battery site.\nMethods for Handling Waste Disposal\nThis well is being drilled to a depth of 6500 feet with fresh water.\nFrom that depth on salt water will be used. All cuttings and salt\nSaturated material generated will be hauled off Location during and after\ncompletion of the well. Upon the completion of drilling operations, all\nWaste materials including, but not limited to drill cuttings, drilling\nfluids, and burned and unburned trash, shall be completely removed from\nGovernment land as directed by the Project Manager, Garrison Project. No\nwaste material shall be buried on site.\nA. All drill cuttings will be stored on site in a 20 mil plastic lined\npit during drilling and hauled off site prior to reclamation.\nB. All fresh water drilling Fluids will be removed from site or allowed\nto evaporate from the reserve pit.\nc. At. 6500 feet we will be switching over to a brine system. All\nliquid and solid waste that is produced will be hauled from the\nsite, either during or immediately after drilling is completed. All\nwaste stored on location during drilling activities will be stored\nin steel containers or in an earthern dike lined with 20 mil plastic\nliner.\nDe No substantial amount of produced water is expected while drilling.\nThe amount of hydrocarbon that may be produced while testing will be\nstored in a tank. The small amount of loss will be retained in the\nreserve pit. Previous to clean-up operations the hydrocarbon\ngaterials will be skimmed or removed as the situation would dictate.\nE. Sanitary facilities will consist of chemical toilets. Waste\nwill be contained and hauled from the site immediately following the\ndrilling operations.\nF. Garbage and nonflammable waste are to be contained in the trash pit.\nFlammable waste is to be contained in the burn pit. The flammable\ntrash is to be burned periodically. The trash and/or burn pit will\nbe totally enclosed with small mesh wire to prevent wind scattering\nand wildlife entry. The pit will be fenced and flagged to prevent\nentry of livestock. All non-flammable trash will be hauled from\nsite prior to reclamation.\n-MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND_OPERATIONS PLAN\nAll trash, garbage, etc. is to be gathered and burned or hauled from\nthe site at the end of drilling operations. Reserve and mud pits\nwill be trenched as needed and allowed to dry after drilling is\ncompleted and then adequately filled and leveled. All garbage and\npits will be filled as soon as the rig leaves the location.\n8, Ancillary Facilities\nThere are no airstrips, camps or other facilities planned during the\ndrilling of the proposed well.\n9. Well Site Layout\nA. See Exhibit 5 for a cross section of the drill pad with cut and\nfills. Exhibit 5 shows that the location is relatively flat and\nthere will be approximately a three foot cut and one foot of fill on\nthe drill pad.\nRig layout is shown on Exhibit 7. No permanent living facilities\nare planned. However, during drilling operations, three trailers\nwill be on location.\nc. Location of mud &anks; reserve, burn and trash pits; pipe racks;\nand soil material stockpiles are shown on Exhibits 6 and 7.\nPlans for Restoration of Surface\nA. If well is completed as dry hole.\n(1) The reserve pit will be fenced until dry and all drill cuttings\nand salt saturated water material from the pits will be hauled,\npits backfilled, leveled, and contoured. The brush pile will\nbe burned and reincorporated with the top soil. The top soil\nwill be redistributed and seeded.\n(2) If aceess road is not needed, it will be leveled, top soiled,\nand reseeded.\n(3) If there is oil in the pit, it will be removed immediately\nafter drilling.\n(4) Rehabilitation operations will begin immediately after the\ndrilling rig is removed. The trash and/or burn pits will be\ncovered. Produced fluids wiil be removed or flagged overhead\nand fenced immediately. Reseeding and revegetation operations\nshall be accomplished in accordance with the instructions, and\nto the satisfaction, of the Project Manager, Garrison Project.\nThe entire reclamation process will be completed after the\nspring thaw of 1986.\nMULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN\nB. If the well is completed as a producer.\n{1) The pit will be trenched and backfilled as soon as possible and\nall excess liquids will be hauled off site.\n{2} The road will be upgraded as discussed in Section 2 and the\nproduction pad will be reduced in areai extent as discussed in\nSection 6A. The area to be returned to the Game and Fish will\nbe reclaimed as soon as feasible after the well is completed.\nThe reclamation will consist of returning the ground to\noriginal contours and redistributing the top soil and seeding\nwith Brome grass or other seed mixtures as required by the Game\nand Fish. The excess top soil pile will be seeded to prevent\nerosion.\n11. Other Information\nTopography: The location borders the Missouri River floodplain.\nThe surface at the drillsite and on the access road is outleased to\nthe North Dakota Game and Fish Department. The surface settlement\nwith the Game and Fish is attached as Exhibit 12,\nThe nearest occupied dwelling is greater than a mile south of the\nsite.\nTne nearest source for water is approximately 1/4 mile east of the\nlocation.\nAn archeological survey is being conducted and will be submitted\nunder separate cover for inclusion in this application as Exhibit 8.\nDrilling is planned for February 1, 1986. It is anticipated that\ncasing point will be reached within 55 days after commencement of\ndrilling.\nLessee's or Operator's Representative\nBasic Earth Science Systems, Inc.

The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional\nflooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. I urge you to closely monitor\nthese sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage\nif these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National\nWeather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area:\n600 E Boulevard Ave -Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701 )328-8020 Fax (701 )328-8022\nFrom: Allen Schlag [mailto:allen.schlag@noaa.gov]\nSent: Monday, May 12, 2014 1:47 PM\nTo: WILLIAMS; Samuelson, Jerry O.; MCKENZIE; Anton, Amy J.; Ackerman, Laura C.; Engelhardt, Bruce\nW.; Travnicek, Andrea J.; Johnson, Sean M.\nSubject: Missouri River\nGreetings everyone\nJust a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as\nwe go forward into latter half of May and early June (by default this also includes the Yellowstone in\nND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into\nForecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While\nthe Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River\noverall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into\nthe Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us.\nWe will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of\nWilliston at some point in the next couple of weeks.\nWhat exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the\noverall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However. .. there has been\na fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper\nelevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack,\nbut is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time (see the second attached pdf).\nIf I had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is\nreasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range.\nHow exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which I\ndon't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, I think there's a pretty decent chance that we\nwill see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone\nand Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June.\nHistorically, I know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with\nwater levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by\nring dikes or road raises, again ... very good question to which I have no answer.\nOf course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free\nto give me a call.\nAllen\np.s. And as always, feel free to disseminate as you feel is appropriate.\nAllen J. Schlag Service Hydrologist\nWFO-Bismarck\nNational Weather Service\n2301 Univ. Drive, Bldg 27\nBismarck, ND 58504 ph. 701-250-4495\nIf you have question in regards to flood preparation and prevention activities, please feel free to\ncontact me at your convenience. You can reach me at (701) 770-3554 or e-mail at rsdunn@nd.gov.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nRichard S.

The Baker Field is located in the\nU.S. portion of the Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Due to its\ntocation on the Missouri River floodplain, a gravel pad was built up above the\nsurrounding ground elevation for the drilling of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H and any\nsubsequent wells drilled from this location. The planned bottom hole location for the\ninitial lateral in the Lewis & Clark #2-4 was north and west of the surface location. Later\nsidetracks may be added with different orientations.\nThe primary offset wells used for correlation while drilling the Lewis & Clark #2-\n4H were :\n1) the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. Basic Game & Fish #34-3 (now\nowned by Nance Petroleum Corp.), with the surface location 392\u2019 FSL\n& 494\u2019 FWL in the SW SW Section 2, T153N, R1Q1W, McKenzie Co.,\nN.D. The Basic Game & Fish was drilled directionally in late 1985 from\na pad in the SW SW Section 2 to a bottom hole location in the SE SE\nSection 3, Completed in the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon\nFormation, the original well produced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG,\nand 6,623\u2019 BW through mid 2002. Nance re-entered the Basic Game\n& Fish in November af 2003 and drilled a 3,800\u2019 horizontal teg in the\nNesson. The bottom hole location of the horizontal leg was in the NE\nSW Section 3, 1,976\" North and 4,338.8' West of the surface location.\nRecent production from the Nesson lateral has averaged 220 BOPD.\n2) the John L. Cox French-Pinney #24-3 (now awned by Nance\nPetroleum Corp.), located 660' FSL & 1,955\u2019 FWL in the SE SW\nSection 3, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Go., N.D. The French-Pinney\nwas drilled in 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation\n(Ordovician in age). The French-Pinney IP\u2019d for 276 BOPD, 486\nMCFG, and 0 BWPD, and has produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456\nMCFG, and 193,009 BW from the Red River.\n3) The nearest well to the Lewis & Clark #2-4H is a dry hole drilled by\nJohn L.. Cox in 1989. The Mildred #1 was located 1,325\u2019 FSL and 660\u00b0\nFEL in the NE SE Section 4, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D. The\nMildred was drilled directionally to Red River depths, reaching a\nbottom hole location 2,094.64\u2019 FSL and 642.92\u2019 FEL, still in the NE SE\nSection 4. The Mildred was piugged and abandoned after\nunsuccessfully testing the Nesson and the Red River.\nSUNBURS)\nCONSULTING\nBCE OLOCY St nViCt\n4) Across the Missouri River from the Lewis & Clark #2-4H in the Todd\nField are the Zinke & Trumbo, Inc. Foster #1-32 [200\u2019 FNL, 700\u2019 FWL,\nNW NW Section 32, T154N, R101W, Williams Co., N.D.] and the\nDavidson #1 [670 FSL, 1,970\u2019 FWL SE SW Section 29, T154N,\nR101W, Williams Co., N.D.] both producing from the Nesson.\nENGINEERING\nThe surface location for the Lewis & Clark #2-4H is 2,094' from the North line &\n332' from the East line, in the Southeast quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 4,\nTownship 153 North, Range 101 West, McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was\nspudded with Nabors Drilling USA Rig #417 on April 13, 2003. Surface hole was drilled\nwith 13.75\u201d bits and fresh water down to 3,008\u2019. A string of 10.75\u201d surface casing was\nset and cemented at 3,008\u2019. Drilling out of the surface casing commenced with 9.875\u201d\nbits and Invert Oil mud. Ice dams on the Missouri River caused flooding which\neventually threatened the location, therefore the drilling was suspended at 4,188\u2019. The\ndrill string was tripped out and laid down and the derrick was laid over to await the\nrecession of the flood. The well was in suspense for 12 days. Drilling resumed after the\nflood waters receded and the location and road dried out.\nDrilling proceeded to the directional kick off point at 8,730\u2019. A Baker Hughes\nInteq gyroscopic survey was made of the hole down to the kick off point to accurately\ndetermine the starting point for directional operations. The results of the gyroscopic\nsurvey placed the hole at 8,575\u2019 at 35.4\u2019 South and 38.3\u2019 West of the surface location.\nBaker Hughes Inteq provided directional supervision, and MWD with Gamma Ray for\nthe directional drilling operation. The first portion of the curve was built using 9.875\u201d bits\ndown to a projected 70\u00b0 at 9,224\u2019 MD [Measured Depth]. A string of 7\u201d and 7.625\u201d\ncasing was run and cemented to 9,224\u2019 MD. The drilling fluid was switched over to\nfresh water with polymer sweeps for hole cleaning. The curve was drilled ahead with 6\u201d\nbits. The first mud motor out from intermediate casing under-performed both in\npenetration rate and angle build and had to be replaced. Due to the poor performance\nof the initial motor run after casing, the curve was landed in the Nesson at a steeper\nangle than planned. The top of the Nesson was cut at a hole angle of 81.5\u00b0. The curve\nwas continued to bring the trajectory back up and leveled off in the upper Nesson.\nHowever, the well path drilled back out the top of the Nesson into the overlying Midale\nbefore the hole angle could be brought back to 90\u00b0 (horizontal). The well path was\nbrought back down into the Nesson after drilling 530\u2019 MD in the overlying Midale.\nThe well path traversed downward through the upper Nesson with only minor\nshows. The first significant shows were observed around the mid-Nesson beginning at\n10,207\u2019 MD. The MWD stopped pulsing and the drilling string was tripped out at 10,455\u2019\nMD. After returning to drilling, the hole angle dropped while accomplishing the planned\nazimuth turn to the west. At the same time the dip angle changed. These two factors\ncombined to cause the well path to drill out of the base of the Nesson by 10,560\u2019 MD.\nAlso, shortly after resuming drilling the MWD gamma ray sensor failed and the lateral\nwas drilled ahead without benefit of the gamma ray data. The lateral was drilled ahead\nto the original planned total depth (based on the hardline restrictions for the existing\nspacing unit in the Northeast Quarter of Section 4). At 11,605\u2019 MD (the end of Lateral\n#1) the bottom hole location was projected at 1,230.87\u2019 North and 1,709.7\u2019 West of the\nsurface location. This equates to approximately 863.13\u2019 FNL & 2,041.7\u2019 FEL in the NW\nNE Section 4.\nA Schlumberger Platform Express Log Suite with FMI was run on drill pipe over\nthe open hole from the intermediate casing shoe to total depth in Lateral #1. Meanwhile\nNance Petroleum Corp. representatives went before the North Dakota Industrial\nCommission \u2014 Oil & Gas Division to petition for a change in the spacing unit to include\nthe entire north half of Section 4. The request was granted, allowing the continuation of\nthe Lewis & Clark #2-4H lateral to the west. Analysis of the electric log data along with\nthe paucity of shows in the later portions of Lateral #1 seemed to indicate the need for\nsidetracking the hole to maximize exposure to the more productive portions of the upper\nMission Canyon (Nesson).\nThe decision was made to pull back to 10,364\u2019 MD and initiate an open hole\nsidetrack while in the mid-Nesson show zone. Sidetrack #1 was started at 10,364\u2019 MD\noff of Lateral #1. Sidetrack #1 proceeded in zone, in the mid-Nesson porosity, until the\nMWD stopped pulsing around 10,693\u2019 MD. After the trip for MWD change the well path\nwas pushed up towards the top of the Nesson to check for possible porosity\ndevelopment. Poor shows were encountered near the top of the Nesson and the well\npath was steered back down to the mid-Nesson show zone. Pressure spikes, abundant\nmetal in the samples and reduced drill rates prompted a trip at 11,788\u2019 MD. The well\npath traversed through the mid-Nesson show zone for the next several hundred feet of\nlateral, but the zone did not seem developed enough to \u201ccapture\u201d the bit (to reduce the\nneed for constant steering corrections). Beginning around 12,600\u2019 MD the well path\nwas steered back up to the top of the Nesson to check for porosity development. An\napparent \u201ctight streak\u201d held the well path down away from the top. At trip was made at\n12,901\u2019 MD to replace a failed MWD gamma sensor. After significant steering efforts\nand time drilling, the \u201ctight streak\u201d was breached and the top Nesson porosity was\nencountered. However, the hole angle achieved to break through the \u201ctight streak\u201d was\ntoo great to keep from drilling out the top of the Nesson and into the overlying Midale.\nThe well path was brought back down into the Nesson in 120\u2019 and the balance of\nSidetrack #1 was drilled in the upper Nesson.\nSidetrack #1 reached total depth at 13,755' MD, when drill string torque and drag\nreached excessive levels for continued safe drilling. The Bottom Hole Location [BHL] at\ntotal depth in Sidetrack #1 was 1,350.45\u2019 North & 3,843.62\u2019 West of the surface location,\nat approximately 743.6\u2019 FNL & 1,116.8 FWL in the NW NW of Section 4.\nThe drilling of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H took 40 operating days (plus the 12 days\nsuspended due to flooding) and ~584 rotating hours. A total of 1,775 barrels of water\nwere lost during drilling. The Nesson laterals were left uncased for an acid stimulation\nand horizontal completion.\nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION\nThe geologic evaluation of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H began in the Charles\nFormation (Mississippian in age) below the 1\u00b0\u2018 major salt. Sunburst Consulting provided\ntwo well site geologists and a digital gas detection system. The digital gas information\nwas augmented by the use of a digital gas chromatograph. Drilling rig data (including\nROP [Rate of Penetration], on-off bottom status, and mud pump strokes) were received\nthrough a digital connection to the rig EDR [Electronic Data Recorder]. The Sunburst\ngas detection readings were returned for display and monitoring to the rig EDR.\nEngineering and geologic data were then compiled and distributed on a digital drafting\nand Internet communications system.\nBUILD CURVE\nAfter drilling down to the planned KOP at the base of the 2\u201d to last Charles Salt\nthe directional tools were picked up to begin the curve build portion of the well. The\nbase of the 2\u201d to the last Charles salt came in at 8,732\u2019 MD, 8,731\u2019 TVD (-6859\u2019) which\nwas 18\u2019 low to prognosis. The Base Last Salt came in at 8,921\u2019 MD, 8,909\u2019 TVD (-\n7037\u2019), also 18\u2019 low to prognosis. The Ratcliffe interval of the lower Charles was\nencountered at 9,024' MD, 8,988' TVD, (-7116'), 20\u2019 low to prognosis. There was a\nslight hydrocarbon show identified within the Ratcliffe interval between 9,064\u2019 and 9,078\u2019\nMD. Gas peaked at 71 units [1% methane in air = 100 units] with some \u201cheavy gas\u201d\ncomponents (C3s & Cas). Samples recovered from this Ratcliffe show interval included\nLimestone: medium to light gray brown, very fine crystalline, occasional spotty black oil\nstain, dull green fluorescence, slow streaming cut in part, very poor intercrystalline\nporosity, occasionally anhydritic. These shows were considered fair for the Ratcliffe\ninterval in this area, and warrant further investigation when taken together with the\nmuch stronger show in the Basic Game & Fish well nearby.\nThe Midale interval (also a member of the Charles Formation) was topped at\n9,149' MD, 9,064' TVD, (-7192'). There were only trace sample shows observed within\nthe Midale, with no significant background gas increases. The curve was built to near\n70\u00b0 where intermediate casing was set in the Midale interval of the lower Charles\nFormation and the drilling fluid was switched from Invert Oil to fresh water.\nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation (Nesson zone) was reached at 9,375'\nMD, 9,142.6' TVD (-7270.6') in the curve building portion of the lateral. The Nesson top\ncame in a little over 20\u2019 low to prognosis. Samples from the initial contact with the\nNesson contained Limestone: tan, cream, light brown, very fine crystalline, fragmental,\noccasionally peloidal, spotty black oil stain, dull green fluorescence in part, slow\nstreaming cut in part, very poor interparticle porosity, occasional white to clear calcite\ncrystals. Although a respectable show for the Nesson, this was not as good a show as\nthat observed in the Basic Game & Fish well. Background gas readings increased only\nslightly in the Nesson. Due to an unexpectedly aggressive angle build in the last portion\nof the curve, the top of the Nesson was once again encountered at 9,520\u2019 MD, 9,143.3\u2019\nTVD, as the well path moved back up stratigraphically. The well path was brought back\ndown into the Nesson from the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker with some\ndifficulty, taking 530\u2019 MD. The Nesson was re-entered at 10,050\u2019 MD, 9,151.5\u2019 TVD.\nPart of the reason the Nesson was so difficult to get back down to may have been the\napparent 0.89\u00b0 formation down dip during this portion of the lateral.\nThe gas and sample shows were slight following the re-entry into the Nesson at\n10,050\u2019 MD. The gamma ray values were also not as clean as the previous encounter\nwith the top portion of the Nesson. The first significant gas and sample shows were\nobserved beginning after 10,207' MD, 9,157.8 TVD (-7285.8\u2019), which was interpreted to\nbe the mid-Nesson (assuming a 16\u2019 net thickness for the Nesson, this zone appeared\napproximately 8\u2019 down from the top). Gas peaks over 200 units with heavy gas\ncomponents were recorded as the lower 8\u2019 of the Nesson were traversed between\nLA CEOLOGY SERVICES\n10,207\u2019 MD and 10,560\u2019 MD. Samples did contain fragmental textures with occasional\npeloids, but the high energy lithologies observed in the Basic Game & Fish were not\nseen. The MWD gamma ray sensor failed around 10,450\u2019 MD, therefore the higher ;\ngamma signature marking the base of the Nesson was not recorded until later electric\nlogs. There were only trace shows observed from 10,560\u2019 MD to total depth in Lateral\n#1 at 11,605\u2019 MD. Electric logs run on drill pipe at the 11,605\u2019 TD helped to clarify the\nstratigraphic position at that point, and illuminated the lack of porosity development in\nthe upper Nesson in Lateral #1. Electric logs pointed out good porosity development in\nthe lower half of the Nesson and significant fracture counts. The resistivities recorded in\nthe lower Nesson porosity intervals indicate good hydrocarbon saturation.\nCuttings photo 10,450\u2019 MD\nThe decision was made to sidetrack off of Lateral #1 to maximize exposure to the\nmore porous mid-Nesson show intervals and seek out upper Nesson porosity\ndevelopment should it occur further out in the lateral. Sidetrack #1 was initiated at\n10,364\u2019 MD, within the mid-Nesson show zone. Shows similar to those seen in the mid-\nNesson in Lateral #1 were seen once again in the early portions of Sidetrack #1. Once\nthe sidetrack had been established the well path was steered up to the top of the\nNesson to seek better porosity development. However, no significant high porosity was\nencountered between 10,900\u2019 MD and 11,700\u2019 MD as the upper Nesson was traversed\nup and back down. The mid-Nesson was explored between 11,750\u2019 MD and 12,600\u2019\nMD, exhibiting good gas and fair sample shows. Another exploration of the upper\nNesson was made between 12,600\u2019 MD and 12,900\u2019 MD. A resistive \u201ctight streak\u201d\nseemed to be holding the well path down from reaching the top of the Nesson. After\nsignificant effort the \u201ctight streak\u201d was breached and some good porosity development\nwas discovered at the top of the Nesson. The gas readings were subdued due to the\nslow penetration rates sliding up through the \u201ctight streak\u201d, however samples looked\ngood. The contained Limestone: with fragmental and peloidal textures, spotty and\nstylolitic black oil stain in small pin point vugs and slow to moderate streaming cuts.\nThe well path moved up into the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker between\n12,980\u2019 MD and 13,100\u2019 MD. Gas peaks of up to 200 units were recorded coming back\ndown through the uppermost Nesson porosity. The balance of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H\nCuttings photo 12,989\u2019 MD\npursued traversing back and forth through this upper Nesson porosity streak. The\nporous interval appeared to be a foot or less in thickness and the bit did not seem to be\nable to track in it. Therefore, steering was required to maintain relative contact with the\nzone. By this time in the lateral steering (sliding) had become difficult and rotating was\nthe only option for drilling ahead. The Sidetrack #1 finished up with a natural traverse\nup through the top Nesson porosity yielding good shows at 13,350\u2019 MD to 13,550\u2019 MD\nand once again at 13,690\u2019 MD to 13,750\u2019 MD. Drilling was terminated at 13,755\u2019 MD\nwhen torque and drag parameters began to exceed reasonable safety limits.\neo) ae,\nDIP ESTIMATES\nAverage formation dips were calculated using the multiple contact points with\nknown (or suspected) equivalent stratigraphic markers. The estimates are \u201cstraight line\u201d\nextrapolations, but serve to give an approximate average dip. The large variation in the\ndip estimates may be due to the drilling of the lateral along the edge of a structure, or\nminor short term variations in the dip.

The lateral exposed a net 4,380!\nfollowing the initial penetrations of the top of the Nesson. The vast majority of the\nlateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson or stratigraphically near the\nNesson. The Lewis & Clark #2-4H required 40 drilling days or approximately 584\nrotating hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with few delays or\nproblems. General sample quality was rated as fair in the lateral. The show quality in\nthe lateral was poor to fair, with obvious oil staining and visibie open porosity only\nevident in the mid-Nesson show zone and a thin streak at the top of the Nesson during\nthe final 900\u2019 of lateral.\nSEIS,\nCONSULTING\nA\n)\nCY\nCONCLUSIONS\n1)\n2)\n3)\na SN\nThe well was kicked off in the lower Charles Formation (base of the 2\" to\nthe last salt), which came in 18\u00b0 low to prognosis.\nAsmall shaw was encountered in the Ratcliffe, which corresponds to the\nshow interval seen in the nearby Basic Game & Fish #34-3H well.\nThe Lewis & Clark #2-4H was successfully steered to a horizontal\ntrajectory in the targeted Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon Formation.\nOne open hole sidetrack was performed to keep the well path in the target\nZone. Tubing-conveyed electric logs were of significant help in devising\nthe revised targeting of the lateral and in identifying fracture density and\norientations.\nThere were 5,621' measured depth drilled in the two laterals following the\ninitial penetration of the Nesson (4,380' from the initial entry point in\nLateral #1 to the end of Sidetrack #1), Of the total footage drilled (5,621\u2019)\nafter initial penetration of the Nesson: 3,926' (or 70%) were drilled in the\nNesson,; 650\u00b0 (or 12%) were drilled just above the Nesson in the basal\nMidale; and 1,045\u2019 (or 18%) were drill below the Nesson.\nSample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair hydrocarbon\nproduction potential for the lateral. Fluid losses indicate some\npermeability.

We have determined that the top of the cement behind the 7-inch casing string\nis at a depth of 4914 feet, The top of the Newcastle Formation is picked from logs at\n489) feet, The North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-21 requires that\nsufficient cement be used to isolate the Dakota Group, of which the Newcastle Formation\nig a part.\nSince the Newcastle Formation is not properly isolated, approval may be given\npermission to monitor the surface-production casing annulus. This approval may be\ngranted in lieu of an immediate cement squeeze, contingent upon the following\nstipulations:\n1. The surface \u2014 production casing annulus must be continuously\nmonitored with an accurate pressure gauge.\n2. The pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300-psi gauge.\n3.

The proposed wellsite and surveyor's plat is shown on Exhibit \u201cD\u201d,\nB. To drive to the wellsite, you drive 3,3 miles south of the junction of U.S, Highway 2\nand U.S, Highway 85 to the Section line between Section 5 and Section 8 and turn\neast on an elevated graveled road and go east 2.05 miles. Then turn north and go 0.65\nmiles on an existing road to junction of new access road. The new access road goes\n0.15 of a mile NEo the proposed drill site pad. The proposed wellsite pad is 6.2\nmiles from the junction of U.S. Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 85 and 10.0 miles from\nWilliston, North Dakota.\nC. The existing roads will be maintained in as good or better condition than they were\nbefore the drilling and completion operations commenced.\nD, Exhibit \u201cA\u201d shows the route from Williston, North Dakota to the proposed wellsite,\nAccess Roads\nThe access road is divided into two parts, The first part is the Access Road from the\nFrench Pinney to the Gate and the second part is the Access Road from the Gate to the\nLoeation.\nA. Access Road from the French Pinney to the Gate.\nThis portion of the total road starts from the existing gravel road at the\nFrench Pinney and stops at the North Dakota Game & Fish gate (\"Gate\")\napproximately 2,904 feet from the French Pinney location or .55 miles.\nThe new access road will be built on a ground stabilizing liner such as\nDupont's Typar. The liner will be placed on the excisting surface and all\nroad construction material placed on the liner,\nPage 2 Final\n9/27/02\nRegardless of the outcome of the proposed well, this section of the Access\nRoad will not be reclaimed. However, if the well is completed as a producer,\nit will be upgraded according to sub-section 2C herein.\nAccess Road from the Gate to the Location.\nThis portion of the total road starts from the existing Gate and will end at the\nLocation. The Acccss Road from the Gate to the Location is approximately\n924 feet or .17 miles.\nThe new access road will be built on a ground stabilizing liner such as\nDupont's Typar. The liner will be placed on the excisting surface and all\nroad construction material placed on the liner.\nIf the proposed well is a dry hole, the Access Road from the Gate to the\nLocation will be reclaimed within six (6) months, pending weather\nconditions.\nUpgrade of Access Roads\nIf the proposed well is completed as a producer, the Access Roads will be\nupgraded with three (3) inches of gravel. In addition, the following upgrades\nwill be made:\n1) The width of the new access road will be a maximum of 25\u2019 wide.\n2) The maximwin grade will be 2 percent,\n3) No ents or fills will be required.\n4) No turnouts will be required, Ifthe well is a producer, a public parking lot\nmeasuring 40\u2019 x 60' will be constructed adjacent to the access roads and well\npad.\n5) No additional drainage consisting of ditching or water bars will be required.\n6) A culvert of sufficient size will be installed at the Gate.\n7) Acattle guard or gate maybe required near the drill pad entrance.\n8) Cross country traffic will not be allowed.\n9) No additional surface material should be required. If any surfacing material is\nrequired it will be obtained from private contractors unless otherwise agreed and\nwill be free from noxious weeds. The Corps of Engineers will be notified of the\nsource point of all fill material prior to road construction.\n10) Exhibit \u201cB\u201d shows roads within a three mile radius of the proposed well.\nPage 3 Final\n9/27/02\n11) The Access Road from the Gate to the Location and parking lot will be fenced\nwith a two (2) strand wire fence on both sides to prevent cross country traffic.\nA walk-through gate will be installed near the parking lot. This fence and gate\nwill be installed prior to drilling.\nD. Material for Access Roads\nDirt fill from the man-made drainage ditches may be used for the building up of the\nAccess Roads and Location. However, approval, in writing, must first be obtained\nfrom the North Dakota Game & Fish. The approval letter will have attached a map\nindicating the location of such drainage ditches and any requirements associated\ntherewith.\n3. Location of Existing Wells\nA. Exhibit \u201cC\u201d shows all the existing wells in a one-mile radius of the proposed well,\nB, There are no injection wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well.\nC, There is one plugged and abandoned well within a one-mile radius of the proposed\nwell, The Cox-Mildred #1 in Section 4.\nD, There are no disposal wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well.\nE. There are no drilling wells within a one-mile radius of this well as of September 4,\n2002.\nF, There are two producing wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well and they\nare listed below:\n1) John L. Cox #31-10 Basic Corps of Engr, (660' FNL & 2305' FEL) Sec, 10 (Red\nRiver);\n2) John L. Cox 24-3 French Pinney (660' FSL & 1985' FWL) Sec, 3 (Red River),\nG, There are no shut-in gas or oil wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well.\nH. There are no monitoring or observation wells within a one-mile radius of the\nproposed well.\nLocation of Existing or Proposed Facilities\nA, Zinke and Trumbo, Inc. do not have any oil and gas production facilities within a five\nmile radius of the proposed well.\nB. Exhibits \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut and fill. The\nproduction pad layout is shown on Exhibit \u201cF\u201d. The drilling pad will be built up 2.1\nfeet to elevation 1851\u2019 m.s.I. and a ring dike built around the location 7' high to\nPage 4 Final\n9/27/02\nclevation 1858\u2019 m.s.l. and cross-section as shown in Exhibit \u201cE\u201d. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary contained herein, the ring dike is only required if the well is a\nproducer,\n. Ifthis proposed well is successfully completed as a producer, the production\nequipment will be located on the wellsite pad as shown on Exhibit \u201cG\u201d. The\nequipment will be painted a flat tan color.\n. The soil used in construction of the pad base will be treated with a ground stabilizer\nmaterial such as Dupont's Typar. Fill dirt and scoria will be placed on top of that\nmaterial to increase the height of the location pad to 1851' elevation. The material to\nraise the height of the location will be purchased from private contractors or from the\narea if prior approval, in writing, is obtained from the North Dakota Fish and Game,\nWilliston, North Dakota and will be free from noxious weeds. Dikes will be installed\nto make sure that no hydrocarbons can escape from the site and any spill of\nhydrocarbons can be easily and rapidly recovered and the spill area cleaned up,\nNew facilities contemplated if well is completed as a producer are shown on Exhibit\neG\u201d,\n1) Proposed tank battery and production equipment are as shown on Exhibit \u201cG\u201d,\nTanks and treater will be diked immediately upon production. Transfer pipes\nbetween tanks and treater will be diked or buried. Tanks will be diked to one\nhundred fifty percent (150%) of capacity,\n2) Dimension of the facilities are shown on Exhibit \u201cG\u201d,\n3) All gas emissions will be combined into one flare pit,\n4) All Ajax pump motors will be fitted and maintained with Hospital Grade\nmufflers that will meet state and local decibel limits,\n5) The soil will be stabilized with ground stabilization material, such as Dupont\u2019s\n20 mil thickness Typar or similar material with 200 psi burst strength.\nFill dirt will be obtained from approved outside sources, unless otherwise\nagreed to, and scoria will then be placed on top of that material to raise the\nlocation.\nConstruction methods will be employed to assure that drainage flows are\nimpounded to prevent the loss of any hydrocarbon from the site. This is to be\ndone in a manner to facilitate rapid recovery and clean up.\nPage 5 Final\n9727102\n6) Protective measures to protect wildlife and livestock will be taken as follows:\na) Weights on the pumping unit will be enclosed.\nb) Production (flare pit) will be diked.\nc) The entire exterior of the well pad will be fenced with a two (2) strand\nfence,\nF. Upon completion of well, areas required for continued use will be graded to provide\ndrainage and minimize erosion. Those areas unnecessary for use will be be reclaimed\nby removing all fill dirt, scoira and the liner from lands of the United States. The\nreclaimed areas will be seeded with a grass mixture as _prescribedby the Corps of\nEngineers and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. It is recognized that\nadditional wells may be drilled from the initial location and if the proposed well is a\nproducer, the reclamation process will not start until one year after first production,\nThe time period will allow the planning and drilling of one or more additional wells,\nLocation and Type of Water\nA. Fresh water for spudding and drilling the first 3,000 feet will be purchased form the\nCity of Williston and will be trucked to the location over the roads shown on Exhibit\n\u201cB\u201d, Salt water for the salt-saturated mud system will be trucked from Williston,\nB. Salt and fresh water will be trucked to location over the roads marked on Exhibit\n\u201cpr\nSource of Construction Materials\nA. Exhibit \u201cH\u201d shows the layout of the planned pad for drilling purposes, This layout\nrepresents the maximum area to be disturbed. We calculate this pad will cover an\narea from the spotted location extending approximately 150' cast, 150\u2019 west, 200\u00b0\nsouth, and 200' north,\nThis location will be built by first laying down a ground stabilization material, such as\nDuPont's 20 mil thickness Typar with 200 psi burst strength. This will be laid directly\non top of the ground, and the surface will be built-up with one foot, six inches (1'6\") of\nsoil, and an additional six (6) inches of scoria to a base elevation of 1851' m.s.1. for the\nentire drilling pad.\nThe area to be made into a drain pit (6' x 20\u2019) will be constructed entirely above the\ncurrent surface elevation. Drain pit will be lined with Dupont\u2019s 20 mil thickness non-\nporous Typar with 200 psi burst strength.\nThe drain pit will be fenced with a two (2) strand fence on three sides during drilling\nand on the fourth side once the rig is removed.\nIf the well is productive, the drillsite wilt be reclaimed in accordance with Paragraph\nPage 6 Final\n9/27/02\n4.F. and an area sufficient for the wellhead and a completion rig will be left at the\nproposed drillsite. The production equipment will then be installed as shown on\nExhibit \u201cG\u201d. The production padwill be ring diked to a minimum elevation of 1,858\nm.s.1. Gravel will then be placed on the production pad. Construction materials will\nconsist of soil, scoria and gravel brought in from private sources and free of noxious\nweeds. Gravel will be used as needed. The Corps of Engineers will be notified of the\nsource point of all fill material prior to placement.\nB. The planned site and access roads are outleased to the North Dakota Game and Fish\nDepartment.\nC. All gravel (containing no noxious weeds) will be obtained from private land in\nquantities necessary for the road surfacing and tank base material on the battery site,\n1 ethods of Handling Waste Disposal for Totally Closed Svstem (No Reserve Pit)\nThe well is being drilled to a depth of 3,000 feet or the Fox Hills formation, whichever\noceurs first, with fresh water, From that depth on, salt water or oil base will be used, All\ncuttings and salt saturated material generated will be hauled off location during and after\ncompletion of the well, Upon the completion of drilling operations, all waste materials\nincluding, but not limited to drill cuttings, drilling fluids, and all trash, shall be completely\nremoved from Government land as directed by the Project Manager, Garrison Project. No\nwaste material shall be buried onsite.\nContainment of drilling fluids will be in three (3) steel pits and two (2) reserve steel pits.\nEach steel pit has a capacity of 400-500 barrels, contents of which will be haule: to\nan approved disposal system, The Corps of Engineers shall be notified of the locationof\nthe disposal site prior to drilling the well.\nA, All drill cuttings will be hauled ftom site to an approved disposal site during drilling\noperations. Drain pit (6' x 20\u00b0) will be tined with Dupont\u2019s 20 mil thickness \u2018Typar with\n200 psi burst strength.\nB. All excess fresh water drilling fluids and solids will be removed from site to an\napproved disposal site.\nC. At 3,000 feet, the well will be switching over to a brine system. All liquid and solid\nwaste that is produced will be hauled from the site, either during or immediately after\ndrilling is completed. All waste stored on location during drilling activities will be\nstored in steel containers or in a drain pit lined with 20 mil plastic Hiner with a minimum\n200 psi burst strength. Salt water tanks will be located entirely on the drilling location\nwithin the location dike.\nPage 7 Final\n9/27/02\nD. No produced water is expected while drilling. The amount of hydrocarbon that may be\nproduced while testing will be stored in a steel tank. Previous to clean up operations,\nthe hydrocarbon material will be removed by hauling to an approved disposal site as the\nsituation would dictate.\nE. Sanitary facilities will consist of chemical toilets. Waste will be contained and hauled\nfrom the site weekly during drilling operations and immediately following drilling\noperations.\nF. Garbage, flamable and nonflammable waste are to be contained in the trash container.\nG, All trash, garbage, etc.. is to be gathered and hauled from the site at the end of the\ndrilling operations, Trash and drain pits will be filled as soon as the rig loaves the\nlocation. All liners will be removed from the pits prior to backfilling.\nAncillary Facilities\nThere are no airstrips, camps or other facilities planned during the drilling of the\nproposed well,\nWellsite Lavout\nA, See Exhibit \u201cE\u201d for a cross section of the drill pad with cut and fills. Exhibit \u201cE\u201d\nshows that there will be three foot or more of fill on the drill pad.\nB, Rig layout is shown on Exhibit \u201cH\u201d, No permanent living facilities are planned,\nHowever, during drilling operations, three trailers will be on location.\nC. Location of mud tanks; drain pit; pipe racks; and soil material stockpiles are shown\non Exhibits \u201cH\u201d,\n10, Plans for Restoration of the Surface\nA, Ifthe well will be completed as a dryhole:\n1) All restoration procedures will be coordinated with the Corps and North Dakota\nGame & Fish Department, The drain pit will be emptied immediately, and the pit\nliner removed, pit backfilled, leveled and contoured. Prior to backfilling, the\nCorp of Engineers will observe and approve pit cleanup. The drain pit will be\nreclaimed within 31 days after finishing drilling this well.\nPage 8 Final\n9/27/02\n2) When the access road (from the Gate to the Location) is not needed all fill\nmaterial and the ground liner will be removed and the surface reseeded with a\nseed mixture prescribed by the North Dakota Game & Fish Department.\n3) Ifthere is any oil in the drain pit, it will be removed immediately after drilling,\nProduced fluids, drill hole cuttings and fluids and the steel containment tanks will\nbe removed immediately after drilling.\n4) Rehabilitation operations will begin immediately after the drilling rig is removed.\nProduced fluids will be stored in test tanks. All fill material, scoria, gravel and\nthe ground liner will be removed from lands of the United States. Reseeding and\nrevegetation operations shall be accomplished in accordance with the instructions,\nand to the satisfaction of the Project Manager, Garrison Project. The entire\nreclamation process will be completed within six (6) months after finishing\ndrilling the well\nB. Ifthe proposed well is completed as a producer:\n1) The drain pit will be reclaimed and backfilled and all excess liquids will be hauled\noff site, immediately after well completion.\n2) The road will be upgraded as discussed in Section 2 and the production pad will\nbe reduced in areal extent as discussed in Section 4F. The area to be returned to\nthe Game and Fish will be reclaimed within six (6) months after finishing drilling\nthe well. The reclamation will consist of removing all fill material and the\nground liner and seeding with a seed mixture prescribed by the North Dakota\nGame & Fish Department.\n3) The production pad is in a 100 year flood plain, Any facilities and equipment\nwhich can be damaged by floodwater and which cannot be readily moved if'a\nflood is imminent will be placed at a location above, or adequately protected by\ndiking to 1858', the 100 year fload water surface elevation.\nML. Protection of Habitat Areas\nFlood gauges will be installed on each location and on the access road, The construction\nof the ring dike and implementation of the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure\nPlan will further protect the area, If the area should be determined to be in danger of\ninundation above the planned protected area, operator will immediately shut-in the well,\nhaul from the lease all oil production from the oil storage tanks, and salt water from the\nsalt water tank. The tanks will then be filled with fresh water to prevent further danger if\nthe area is inundated. A tubing hanger plug will be installed in wellhead as an additional\nsecurity measure, if the well will still flow. The entire shut-in process will require a\nminimum of twenty-four (24) hours to a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours, Operator\nwill be in daily contact with officials at the Garrison Dam for updated flood information.\nProduction will not be resumed until approval is received from the Corp of Engineers an\nPage 9 Final\n9/27/02\nthe North Dakota Game and Fish indicating that no dangerous or threatening conditions\nexist.\nFences will be erected as necessary to protect the wildlife in the area. No chemicals,\npesticides, or herbicides will be used. If requested by the North Dakota Game and Fish,\nvegetation will be planted on the dikes to prevent erosion. The type of vegetation will be\nas instructed by the representative of the North Dakota Game and Fish.\nNo hazardous materials will be used during the drilling operations.\n12. Other_Information\nA. Topography: The location borders the Missouri River flood plain.\nB. The surface at the drillsite and on the access road is outleased to the North Dakota\nGame and Fish Department, Surface damages will be mitigated in accordance with\nthe conditions of Department of the Army Permit No, 200060047. Mitigation will be\ncompleted by June, 2004, However, if dirt is used from the Corps of Engincers area\nin sufficient quantity to reduce the overall need for outside dirt, a one time surface\ndamage payment totaling $3,000 will be paid to a construction firm of the North\nDakota Game and Fish\u2019s election for specified work to be performed under the\ndirection of the North Dakota Game and Fish office in Williston, North Dakota.\nC. The nearest occupied dwelling is greater than a mile to the south of the site.\nD, The nearest source for water is approximately one (L) mile east southeast of the\nlocation,\n&.

It is a wildcat well positioned east of the Indian\nHill Field of Williston Basin. Wade Federal 5300 21-30H is located approximately 7 miles\nsouth of the town of Williston, North Dakota in McKenzie County.\nThe prognosis proposed a single lateral leg trending 90\u00b0 to be drilled from the SE NW corner of\nSection 30 to the SE NE of Section 29. The lateral portion of Wade Federal 5300 21-30H\ntargeted the porous silty sandstone of the middle member of the Bakken Formation,\napproximately 12\u2019 below the top of the Upper Bakken Shale.\nControl Wells\nTwo completed wells were used as control offsets for the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H.\nThe Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 [NW SE Sec. 26 T153N R101W] is a vertical well owned by\nHarper Oil Company. The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26- 1is located approximately 1.4 miles west of\nWade Federal 21-30H. The initial pilot well for the Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 was spud on 31\nDecember 1979. The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1was drilled to the Red River Formation.\nThe Federal Land Bank 1-26 [NE NW Sec. 26 T153N R101W] is a dry vertical well drilled to\nthe Red River Formation by Mosbacher-Pruet Oil CO. The Federal Land Bank 1-26 is located\napproximately 1.4 miles northwest of the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H. Federal Land Bank 1-26\nwas spud 16 July 1978.\nDuring the curve, the gamma-ray data and e-log data from Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 were\nutilized to help determine proper landing depth for Wade Federal 5300 21-30H.\nA graph was constructed to determine which markers and formation tops could be accurately\nused in landing the curve. Markers with more than 5 feet difference between the offsets were\nwatched but not utilized in decision for moving the TVD target of the curve.\nOffset Well Target Isopachs\n2,500 2,208\nD 2,206\ni\n2,000\ns\n1,526\nt 1,516\na 1,500\nn\nc\n1,000 763\n749\ne\n349 299\nt 500 338 293 187 165 134\no 182 160 131 7782 3237 24 25 10 10\n0\nT\na\nr\ng\ne\nt\nVerlin Fossum 26-1\nFLB 26-1\nGraph1. Distance from formation tops in control wells were utilized to determine the initial drilling target.\nGeologic Assessment\nMethods\nGeologic supervision of Wade Federal 5300 21-30Hwas provided by two experienced RPM well\nsite geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments\nBloodhound (Bloodhound) real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The Bloodhound\ngas detection system uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate\ngases liberated from the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.\nThe Bloodhound was interfaced with a Canrig electronic data recorder system. Canrig provided\nrate of penetration, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and received total gas\ninformation from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely.\nUnder the direction of RPM well site geologist, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill\ncutting samples at 30\u2019 intervals from 8,250 to the kick off point (KOP) at 10,172\u2019. Samples were\ncontinuously logged at 30\u2019 intervals during the curve and throughout the lateral section.\nSampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using plain\n(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d by\nimmersion in carbo-sol (trichloroethylene) and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10%\nhydrochloric acid and alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content\nof rocks and cementing.\nVertical Operations\nOverview\nThe Wade Federal 5300 21-30H was spud on 5 April 2011 using Nabors 149 drilling rig. Prior\nto Rig up of RPM mud logging services, a 9 5/8\u201d hole was drilled with fresh water to\ndepth of 2,018\u2019 and isolated with 9 5/8\u201d 36# J-55 casing cemented to surface. The vertical\nborehole was drilled with bit #1 in 9 hours with an average ROP equal to 213.3 ft/hr. Bit #2 (8\n\u00be\u201d Smith PDC) was used to drill from 2,018\u2019 to KOP at 10,172\u2019 yielding an average ROP of\n95.8 ft/hr.\nRPM well site geologists arrived at site on 10 April 2011 and began logging the vertical section\nat 8,250\u2019.\nDiesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight of ranging from 9.7-10.0 ppg was used during\nremainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections.\nSchlumberger performed openhole electronic logging operations on 13 April 2011.\nLithology\nThe top of the Kibbey Lime [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,320\u2019 (-6,008\u2019), 83\u2019\nlow to the Verlin Fossum 26-1. Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were described as:\nLIMESTONE: wackestone, off white, cream, light brown, firm to hard, microcrystalline,\ncrystalline texture, common fossils fragment, good visible porosity\nThe top of the Charles Salt [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,486\u2019 (-6,448\u2019), 93\u2019\nlow to the Verlin Fossum 26-1. The Base Last Salt was drilled at 9,655\u2019 (-6,264\u2019), 66\u2019low to the\nVerlin Fossum 26-1. Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were described as:\nANHYDRITE: white, dark gray, soft, cryptocrystalline, amorphous texture\nLIMESTONE: mudstone, light to medium gray, soft, microcrystalline texture,\ntrace fossils fragment, very lite disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity;\ninterbedded white anhydrite in part\nSalt: clear, milky, translucent, crystalline, hard, euhedral to subhedral, crystalline\ntexture\nFigure 1: Photograph of limestone, salt and anhydrite seen in sample from the Charles Formation.\nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation of the Madison Group [Mississippian] was\npenetrated at 9,356\u2019 (-7,318), 70\u2019 low to the Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Figure 2). Samples from this\ninterval were described as:\nLIMESTONE: mudstone to wackestone, mottled gray to brown, light gray,\nmicrocrystalline, firm to soft, earthy texture, trace sparry calcite, trace fossils fragment,\nno visible porosity, no visible oil stain; Trace ANHYDRITE\nFigure 2: Photograph of limestone and anhydrite from the Mission Canyon Formation.\nThe top of the Lodgepole Formation of the Madison Group (Mississippian) was logged at\n9,934\u2019 (-7,896\u2019), 79\u2019 low to Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Figure 3). Samples collected from the\nLodgepole Formation were described as:\nLIMESTONE: mudstone, medium to light brown, cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline,\nfirm to friable, crystalline to earthy texture, trace sparry calcite, argillaceous in part, no\nvisible oil stain, no visible porosity\nFigure 3: Photograph of limestone from Lodgepole Formation\nDirectional Operations\nRPM provided equipment and personnel for directional services. Ryan Energy Technologies\n(Ryan) provided equipment and personnel for MWD services. RPM geologists worked closely\nwith RPM directional and Ryan MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize\nexposure of borehole in the pay zone. RPM well site geologists closely observed MWD gamma-\nray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations.\nCurve Build\nOverview\nBit #3 and was used in front of a 2.3\u00b0 fixed mud motor to drill the curve from measured\ndepth 10,172\u2019 to 11,023\u2019. Bit #3, an 8 \u00be\u201d Security PDC was used to drill from 11,172\u2019 to\n11,023\u2019 in 31.5 hours generating an average ROP of 27 ft/hr.\nDuring the curve progression, isopach data of gamma-ray signatures from Verlin Fossum 26-1\nwas compared to gamma-ray readings from the MWD tool from the Base Charles Salt (Table\n1). Prospective markers were entered into Table 2 to determine the target landing point. Based\non the marker pick for the Base Charles Salt, the target TVD for the curve was raised 10 feet to\n11,655\u2019 but was lowered back down to 10,670\u2019 as the curve progressed. The curve was\ncompleted at a measured depth of 11,020\u2019and TVD of ~ 11,669\u2019.\nVerlin Fossum Dist.

The target zone was an area marked\nroughly between the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cD\u201d markers on chart 1. The attempt was made to keep the well\nbore in this region for as much of the drilling operations as possible.\nThe Middle Member of the Bakken Formation seen in drilling samples consisted of 2 primary\nfacies. The upper most was the gray siltstone seen while landing the curve and described above.\nThe second was described as sandstone interbedded with a light brown silty sandstone. This silty\nsandstone consisted of a siltstone that was flaky and grey in color interbedded with a light brown\nsandstone (Figure 7). There was a substantial amount of oil stain present in the sandstone and\nhydrocarbon cuts produced a weak diffuse cut with few streaming cuts Samples from the top of\nthe Middle Bakken member were described as:\nSLTY SANDSTONE: white, tan to brown, light to medium gray, firm to friable, sub\nrounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, calcite to dolomite cement, trace\ndisseminated and nodules pyrite, vitreous texture, trace intergranular porosity, possible\nfracture porosity, moderately light brown oil stain, slightly faint white to yellow diffuse\ncut\nFigure 7: Photograph of silty sandstone seen in the upper part of the target zone between \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d\nAs the bit approached \u201cD\u201d in the middle member, silty sandstone was seen in sample (Figure 8).\nThis silty sandstone was darker grey in color, contained much less sandstone and held together\nwith a weaker calcite cementing. Hydrocarbon cuts produced a weaker diffuse cut than the\nsandstone above, but still few streamers. This silty sandstone comprised the primary target zone\nthat we were attempting to keep the well bore in (Diagram 1).\nFigure 8: Photograph of silty sandstone from lower \u201cTarget Zone\u201d in the Middle Bakken Formation\nGas and Hydrocarbon Shows\nTotal gas levels were recorded with an average background of ~ 150 units while drilling\nthe curve through the Lodgepole Formation. At a measured depth of 10,520\u2019 gas levels rose\nquickly to a peak of near 1900 units and maintained a background of ~ 700 units. Gas levels\nelevated sharply at the Upper Bakken Shale with a peak of 1450 units and an average\nbackground gas of ~ 1000 units. Gas levels changed little after the penetration of the middle\nmember of the Bakken Formation until reaching intermediate casing point at 11,023\u2019 MD.\nUpon exiting the show gas levels immediately rose to over 2200 units. The gas remained\nbetween 2000 and 2200 units until after a measured depth of 11,420 when levels rose to over\n3000 units and remained at this level till the bit reach TD at a measured depth of 20,482\u2019. The\nBloodhound gas chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire\nlateral (Figure 10)\nHydrocarbon cuts using trichloroethylene were moderate though the entire lateral.

The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,172\u2019.\n2) A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.7 \u2013 9.9 ppg) after surface casing and\nthrough the curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable\nhole conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a\nweight of 9.4-9.5 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic\nbalance.\n3) One 9 5/8\u201d PDC bit was used to drill to surface casing at a depth of 2,025\u2019 in 9 hours. One 8\n\u00be\u201d PDC bit was used to drill the vertical hole from surface casing to KOP of 10,172\u2019 in a total of\n5.8 hours. One 8 \u00be\u201d bits was used to drill through the curve, landing at a measured depth of\n11,023\u2019 in 27 hours. The entire 9,458\u2019 lateral was drilled in 82.6 hours with one 6\u201d PDC bits.\n4) The lateral was targeting a 10\u2019 thick section of the middle member of the Bakken\nFormation situated twenty feet below the upper shale.\n5) Gas levels of between 2000 and 3500 units were maintained through most of the drilling\noperations. A 4-7 foot flare was maintained though most of the drilling operations\n6) The Middle Bakken consisted of 2 gross lithologies.

Chalmers 5300 31-\n19H is situated within a Wildcat Field in McKenzie County. A single lateral leg trending 90\u00b0 was\nproposed to be drilled from the NW SW corner of Section 29 to the NE SW corner of Section 20\ntargeting the porous silty sandstone of the middle member of the Bakken Formation,\napproximately 10 - 20\u2019 below the top of the Upper Bakken Shale.\nControl Wells\nTwo completed wells were used as control offsets on Chalmers 5300 31-19H.\nThe Wade Federal 5300 21-30H [SW NW Section 30, T153N, R100W] is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis\nPetroleum North America, LLC. It was spud 5 April 2011 and drilled to a total depth of 20,482\u2019 into the\nMiddle Bakken Formation. Wade Federal 5300 21-30H is located approximately 0.7 miles South of\nChalmers 5300 31-19H. Itis still operated by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.\nThe Kline Federal 5300 I11-I8H [NW NW Section 18, T153N, R100W] is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis\nPetroleum North America, LLC. It was spud 7 May 2011 and drilled to a total depth of 20,650 into the\nMiddle Bakken Formation. Kline Federal 5300 I1-18H is located approximately 1.5 miles North of\nChalmers 5300 31-19H. It is still operated by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.\nDuring the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Wade Federal 5300 21-\n30H and Kline Federal 5300 11-18H wells. Gamma ray was used to help determine a proper landing depth.\nTo assist in the choosing of an initial target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to\nmeasure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the offset well.\nComparison of gamma ray markers showed the most consistent isopach for up hole formations to\nbe the Base of Charles Salt.\nal Control Wells\nOperator: Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Oasis Petroleum North America LLC\nWell Name: Wade Federal 5300 21-30H Kline Federal 5300 11-I18H\nLocation: SW NW Sec. 30 T153N R1OOW NW NW Sec. 18 T153N R1OOW\nMcKenzie County, ND McKenzie County, ND\n0.7 miles South of Chalmers 5300 31-19H 1.5 miles North of Chalmers 5300 31-19H\nElevation: KB:2038' KB: 2079'\nFoermation/7one E-Log Dera Thickness | Dist to target E-Log Darna Thickness | Dist to target\nCharles Salt 8485 -6,447 653 2,185 8516 -6,437 698 2,215\nBase of Charles Salt 9138 -7,100 772 1,532 9214 -7,135 788 1,517\nLodgepole 9910 -7,872 405 760 40002 -7,923 385 729\nLodgepole Marker A 40315 -8,277 58 355 40387 -8,308 61 344\nLodgepole Marker B. 10373 -8,335 52 297 10448 -8,369 39 283\nLodgepole Marker C 410425 -8,387 56 245 10487 -8,408 52 244\nLodgepole Marker D 10481 -8,443 53 189 10539 -8,460 60 192\nLodgepole Marker E 10534 -8,496 54 136 10599 -8,520 53 132\nLodgepole Marker F 10588 -8,550 49 82 10652 -8,573 45 79\nFalse Bakken 10637 -8,599 11 33 10697 -8,618 10 34\nUpper Bakken Shale 10648 -8,610 14 22 40707 -8,628 14 24\nMiddle Bakken 10662 -8,624 8 8 40721 -8,642 10 10\n7 Target 40670 -8,632 - - 10731 8,652 - -\nTable 1: Distance from Formation tops in control wells were utilized to determine an initial drilling target.\nGeologic Assessment\nMethods\nGeologic supervision of Chalmers 5300 31-19H was provided by two experienced RPM well site\ngeologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments BloodhoundTM\nreal time gas detector and chromatograph system. The Bloodhound gas detection system uses\nnon-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from the\nformation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.\nThe Bloodhound was interfaced with a Canrig electronic data recorder system. Canrig provided\ndrill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and received total gas information\nfrom the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely.\nUnder the direction of RPM well site geologist, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill\ncutting samples at 30\u2019 intervals from 8,120\u2019 throughout the curve and lateral section.\nSampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain\n(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d by\nimmersion in EnTron-AE and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and\nalizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.\nRPM Consulting, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray\ninformation and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations.\nVertical Operations\nOverview\nThe Chalmers 5300 31-19H was spud for surface drilling on 1 September 2011, however the\nNabors 149 drilling rig didn\u2019t actually spud until 4 October 2011. Prior to commencement of\nRPM mud logging services, a 13 1/2\u201d hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 1,915\u2019 and\nisolated with 9 5/8\u201d 36# J-55 casing cemented to surface.\nRPM well site geologists began logging the vertical section at 8,120\u2019.\nOne PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to vertical TD. Bit #2 (8 4\u201d Smith MDSi\n616) PDC was used to drill from 1,915\u2019 to 9,948\u2019 and averaged an ROP of 95.6 fi/hr in 84 hours\nof use\nDiesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight ranging from 9.7-10.3 ppg was used for the\nremainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections. The vertical section was drilled to\na kick off point (KOP) of 9,948\u2019, at which point vertical operations were ceased.\nLithology\nThe top of the Kibby Lime [Pennsylvanian] was logged at 8,225\u2019 (-6,296\u2019). Samples from this\ninterval (Figure 1) were described as:\nLIMESTONE: mudstone, off white, cream, light brown, firm to hard, microcrystalline,\ncrystalline texture, common fossils fragment, good visible porosity\nxX \u201d\nFigure 1: Photograph of limestone indicative of that seen intheKFibobyr Lmimeation,\nNo significant gas shows or increased penetration rates were detected while drilling through\nthe Kibbey Lime.\nThe top of the Charles Salt [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,376\u2019 (-6,447\u2019), level\nto the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H. The Base Last Salt was drilled at 9,043\u2019 (-7,114\u2019), 14 low\nto the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H. Samples from this interval (Figure 2) were described as:\nSALT: clear, milky, translucent, crystalline, hard, euhedral to sub hedral, crystalline\ntexture\nSHALE: orange to red, light brown in part, trace light gray, firm to soft, sub blocky to\nsub platey, earthy texture, slight to moderately calcareous\nANHYDRITE: white, soft, amorphous texture\nFigure 2: Photograph of Limestone, salt and anhydrite seen in sample from the Charles Formation,\nThe top of the Mission Canyon Formation of the Madison Group [Mississippian] was\npenetrated at 9,281\u201d (-7,352\u201d) (Figure 3). Though porosity was not easily detected, visible dead\noil staining was noted. Samples from this interval were described as:\nARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: wackestone, light brown to tan, light to medium\ngray, mottled in part, firm to hard, microcrystalline texture, dolomitic in part, trace\nfossils fragment, possible fracture porosity, trace oil stain\nLIMESTONE: mudstone, light brown to tan, light to medium gray, mottled in part,\nfirm to hard, microcrystalline texture, dolomitic in part, trace fossils fragment,\npossible fracture porosity, trace oil stain\nFigure 3: Photograph of limestone and Anhydrite from the Mission Canyon Formation.\nThe top of the Lodgepole Formation of the Madison Group (Mississippian) was logged at\n9,839\" (-7,910\") (Figure 4). The samples collected from the Lodgepole Formation were\ndescribed as:\nARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: wackestone, light brown to tan, light to medium\ngray, trace cream to white, trace very dark gray, microcrystalline, blocky, firm to hard,\ncrystalline texture, trace fossils fragments, trace algal matting, intergranular porosity,\ntrace oil stain\nFigure 4: Photograph of argillaceous limestone from Lodgepole Formation.\nDirectional Operations\nRPM provided equipment and personnel for directional services. Ryan Energy Technologies\n(Ryan) provided equipment and personnel for MWD services. RPM geologists worked closely\nwith RPM directional and Ryan MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize the\nfootage of borehole in the pay zone.\nCurve Build\nOverview\nBit #3 was an 8 %\u201d Security DBS used in front of a 2.30\u00b0 fixed mud motor to drill the curve from\nmeasured depth 9,948\u2019 to 10,906\u2019 in 33 hours, averaging 29 ft/hr.\nA Chart was constructed for the curve (Chart 1) that compared the isopach of certain easily\nrecognizable gamma markers From the Base of Charles Salt to Middle Bakken Formation on\nthe two control wells. This chart was used to determine which gamma markers had the closest\nisopach thicknesses to the target and therefore the highest confidence in their use to land the\ncurve. The curve was completed at a measured depth of 10,906\u2019and TVD of ~ 10,593\u2019, ~ 10\u2019\nbelow the Upper Bakken Shale.\nOffset Well Target Isopachs\na0\n2,500 (SQN 7\nD vs\ni\ns 2,000 + s 5\nt | a 4h\na a\nn 1,500 } a -\nc\ne\n1,000\n@ Wade Federal 21-30H\nt\n@ Kline Federal 11-18H\n\u00b0 500 |\nT\na 0\njr\nlg a\ne 2\nSe\nt &\n&\nye\nChart1:; Comparing distances from certain gamma markers on offset wells to establish confidence of markers.\nLithology\nThe top of the \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d was penetrated at a measured depth of 10,696\u2019 (TVD 10,550\u2019) (-\n8,621\u2019) suggesting a target depth of 10,590\u2019 TVD.\nThe Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Missippian \u2014 Devonian] was drilled at 10,736\u2019\n(10,566\u2019 TVD) (-8,637\u2019) with sample returns of black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale\n(Figure 5) characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 255 API counts, Gas levels rose\nsharply through the Upper Shale, increasing from a background of ~400 units to over 1300 units,\nand then receded to ~830 units.\nSamples were described as:\nSHALE: very dark gray to brown, sub blocky to blocky, friable to firm, smooth hard,\nwaxy texture, calcareous, occasional disseminated pyrite, no visible oil stain\nFigure 5: Photograph sample from the Upper Bakken Shale.\n( T - h 8 e ,6 M 54 id \u2019) d , l 3 e 0 M \u201d l e o m w b t e o r t o h f e t h W e a B de a k F k e e d n e r F a o l r 5 m 30 a 0 ti 2 o 1 n - 3 w 0 a H s p w e e n l e l. t r T a h te e d u a pp t e 1 r 1 z , o 80 n 6 e \u2019 M of D th , e (1 m 0, i 8 d 5 d 3 le ? m TV em D b ) er\nS d a i I n s L s g T e u S m l T a in O r a , N v te i E t d r : e p g o y r u r a i y s te , t , s o t l r i b g a r c h o e t w p t a n o t , c v n h e y o r t o y i c l fi a s n l t c a e a i n r g e , r o t a r u i a n s c e , e d w i , n e fi te r ll r m g s r o t a o r n t u e fr l d a ia , r b p p l o o e r , o o s r s u l i y t b y c r e o m un e d n e te d d t , o t r s a u c b e\n\\\n~\nFigure 6: Photograph of siltstone from top of middle member of the Bakken Formation,\nakken Formation.\nLateral\nOverview\nDrilling fluid consisting of open system salt water brine (9.9 to 10.3 ppg) was substituted for\ndiesel invert while drilling the lateral section. One 6\u201d PDC bit was used to drill the lateral.\nBit #4 (6\u201d Smith MDi 613), was a PDC bit used to drill the entire lateral from 10,906\u2019 to\n20,300\u2019. The total of 9,394\u2019 was drilled in 120.5 hours for an average rate of penetration of 78.0\nfi/hr,\nAt 0400 hours on 15 October 11, the Upper Bakken Shale was penetrated during horizontal\ndrilling operations at a bottom hole location of 62.66\u2019 S and 2,803.34\u2019 E of surface location,\napproximately 1,472.34\u2019 FSL and 3,178.34\u2019 FWL NE SW Sec. 19, T153N, R1O0W, and forced\nthe decision to sidetrack at 13,000\u2019.\nAfter a successful sidetrack, drilling operations were concluded at 0300 hours on 20 October 11\nat a bottom hole location of 134,577 N & 9,825.31' E of surface location or approximately\n1,669.57\u2019 FSL & 313.06\u2019 FEL NE SE Sec. 20 T153N, R1OOW.\nLithology\nTo aid in communications while drilling the lateral, a type log was created using the gamma\nsignature from the Verlin Fossum 26-1 well in Sec, 26, TIS3N, R101W (Diagram 1). The target\nzone was an area between the red lines on chart 1. The goal was to keep the well bore in this\nregion for as much of the drilling operations as possible.\nThe Middle Member of the Bakken Formation consisted of 2 primary facies. The upper most\nwas the light gray siltstone seen while landing the curve and described above. The second was\nsilty sandstone that was characterized by a light to medium gray color, calcitic to dolomitic\ncementing and patchy oil staining (Figure 7). Samples from this vertical region of the middle\nmember were generally described as:\nSILTY SANDSTONE: light to medium gray, very fine grained, sub angular, firm to\nfriable, moderately sorted, calcareous cement, occasional nodular and disseminated\npyrite, trace intergranular porosity, possible fracture porosity, fast abundant white\nstreaming cut, strong cream to white diffuse cut\nGas and hydrocarbon Shows\nTotal gas levels were recorded with an average background of ~ 100-400 units while drilling the\nLodgepole Formation through most of the curve. Upon penetrating the Bakken Formation the\ntotal gas units immediately increased to over 1000 units, reaching a peak of 1,334 units. The\namount of total gas began to gradually decrease to about 500 units by the casing point at 10,906\u201d\nMD.\nUpon exiting casing, total gas levels picked up to an average of 1500 units and gradually\nincreased to an average of 3000 units by the end of the lateral.\nAs the bit moved through the target zone of the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation total\ngas levels gradually rose from 2800u to over 3300u until the bit began to drop near the bottom of\nthe target zone, at which point gas levels dropped as low as 1010 units. The Bloodhound gas\nchromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire lateral (Figure 8), A\n3-5\u2019 flare was maintained at the flare stack intermittently through the lateral, whenever gas levels\nexceeded about 3000 units. Abundant oil began to wash out of the samples at about 11,800\u2019 and\ncontinued to wash out throughout the lateral, except where the well bore dropped below the\ntarget zone.\n|rear0!\nTotal Gas\nt z a\ne ts a4 = ?\nEigure 8: Screen shot of Bloodhound Chromatograph similar to that seen at the Chalmers\n5300 31-19H well, showing C1-C4 present in formation gas.\nio) ao T\n} + + False Bakken\nLs = ms | ee\nUpper Bakken Shale\nt\n13\" +\n: Middle Bakken\nSandstone\n11 \u2014\nt\nTarget top\n12'\nTarget base\na\u201c Lower Bakken Shale\nt +\ni .\n\u00a3\n+\n+\nt\nr ) Diagram 1: Type log created from gamma log of the Verlin Fossum 26-1 well.

The well was spud by Nabors 149\non 4 October 2011. The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,906\u2019.\n2) A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.7 \u2014 10.3 ppg) after surface casing and\nthrough the curve build sections. Brine water with a weight of 9.9 to 10.3 ppg was used\nduring lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance.\n3) A 13 4\u201d bit was used to drill to a depth of 1,915\u2019. Two 8 %\u201d Smith PDC bits were used\nto drill out of surface casing to the KOP. Bit #1 drilled from a depth of 1,915\u2019 to 9,948\u2019,\nwhile Bit #2 dnilled from 9,948\u2019 to 10,906\u2019. The entire 10,352\u2019 lateral was drilled in\n120.5 hours with one 6\u201d Smith PDC bit.\n4) Gas levels between 2800 and 3400 units were maintained through most of the lateral\ndrilling operations.\n5) The Middle Bakken consisted of two observed gross lithologies. Directly below the\nupper Bakken Shale a light gray siltstone was observed. Below this siltstone, silty\nsandstone ranging in colors from light to medium gray with occasional light tan to off\nwhite color to a medium to dark gray was well sorted and very fine grained. The target\nzone was comprised entirely of this silty sandstone.\n6) A 3 to 5 foot flare was present intermittently at the stack through the lateral drilling\noperation.\n7) Abundant oil began washing out of the sample from a measured depth of approximately\n11,800\u2019 until TD at 20,300\u2019, except where the well bore dipped below the bottom of the\ntarget zone.\n8) The Upper Bakken Shale was penetrated during horizontal drilling operations at a bottom\nhole location of 62.66\u2019 S and 2,803.34\u2019 E of surface location, approximately 1,472.34\u2019\nFSL and 3,178.34\" FWL NE SW Sec. 19, T153N, RIOOW, and forced the decision to\nsidetrack at 13,000\u2019.\n9) Drilling operations were concluded at 0300 hours on 20 October 11 at a bottom hole\nlocation of 134.57\u2019 N & 9,825.31' E of surface location or approximately 1,669.57' FSL\n& 313.06\u2019 FEL NE SE Sec. 20 T153N, R100W.\n10) Oasis Petroleum Chalmers 5300 31-19H awaits completion operations to determine its\nultimate production potential.\nRespectfully submitted,\nTim Jahraus\nRPM Geologic LLC\nWell Information\n2\nOperator: Oasis Petroleum APL#: 33-053-034 72-00-00\nAddress: 1001 Fannin Suite 202 ND Well File #: 20407\nHouston, TX 77002\nSurface Location: NW SW Sec. 19, T153N - R100W\nWell Name: Chalmers 5300 31-19H\nFootages: 1535'FSL & 375' FWL\nField/ Prospect: Wildcat\nCounty, State: McKenzie County, North Dakota\nElevation: GL: 1,904'\nKB: 1,929' Basin: Williston\nSpud Date: 71-Sep-11 4-Oct-11 Well Type: Bakken Formation\nContractor: Nabors #149 Chemical Company Dynamic Drilling Fluids\nTeolpushers: Dwight Knutson / Larry Erie Mud Engineer Ryan Buckley, Keith McCarty\nField Supervisors: Mark Lawler, Eli Pucket H.S MONITORING: NA\nirectional Drillin RPM MWD Ryan Energy\nMark Lawlar, Eli Pucket, Jordan Jensen Jace Pitre, Nick Brochu\nWellsite Geologist Tim Jahraus Rock Sampling: 30' from 8,120 to 10,700\nJamie Graham 10' from 10,700 to 10,840\nBrandon Tillet 30\u2019 from 10,840 to 13,267'\nProspect Geologist Mike Box Gas Detector Bloodhound Gas Detection\nSample Examination: Binocular microscope & fluoroscope Sample Cuts: EnTron-AE n-Propyl Bromide (nPB)\nHorizontal Target Middle Bakken Porosity\nKey Offset Wells:\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC Wade Federal 5300 21-30H SW NW Sec. 30 T153N R100W McKenzie County, ND\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC Kline Federal 5300 11-178H NW NW Sec. 18 T153N R100W McKenzie County, ND\nPumps: #1 & #2: National 10P-100 - 5.5\u201d liners Output: 0.0699 bbl/stk\nMud Type; Diesel invert mud 1,915\u2019 - 10,906\" Saltwater 10,906\u2019 - 20,300' (TD)\nSurface: 9 5/8\" 36# J-55 @ 1,915'\nCasing:\nIntermediate: 7\" 271 Jts 29# HCP-110; float collar & casing shoe set to 10,882'\nce Size, 13 1/2\" from conductor pipe at 75' to 1,915' 8 3/4\u201d to 10,906\" 6\" to 20,300\" (TD)\nTotal Dri 3: 12 days\na Target: Middle Bakken Porosity BOTTOM HOLE LOCATION:\n62.66' S & 2803.34 E\nk-Off Point / Date: 9,924' 9 October 2011 of surface location or approximately\n1,472.34' FSL & 3,178.34\" FWL\nTotal Depth/ Date: 9,924' 9 October 2011 NE SW Sec. 19 T153N, R100W\nSidetrack 20,300\u2019 at 03:00 on 20 Oct 11\nEnding Vertical Section 2803.34 Sidetrack\nSidetrack 9,825.31 BOTTOM HOLE LOCATION:\n134.57'N & 9,825.31'E\nEnding Azimuth 92.50\u00b0 of surface location or approximately\n81.70\u00b0 1,669.57' FSL & 313.06\u2019 FEL\nNE SE Sec. 20 T153N, R100W\nStatus of Well: Awaiting completion of well\nExposure to Formation: 99%\nAzimuths to True North SITE DETAILS: Sec. 1971 @ oow\netic North: 8.81\u00b0\nSite Centre Latitude: 48\u00b0 3' ZFE70N\nMagnetic Field PETROLEUM Longitude: 103\u00b0 36' 9.410 W\nStrength: 56793.9snT|\nDip Angle: 73.15\u00b0 . , Positional Uncertainity: 0.0\nDate: 1/4/2011 Project: woken ounty, NO Convergence: -2.31\nModel: |GRF2010) ite: Sec.

The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi\n2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure.\n3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.\n4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.\n5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.\n6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.\n7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.\n\u2018Company Telephone Number\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC 281-404-9491 FOR STATE USE ONLY\nAddress -\n4001 Fannin, Suite 1500 C Receved | XT Approved\nC Ho i fs t t y on [ T State X Zip C o 7 d 7 e 0 0 Da 2 te tb vnade SA\naye A WA pf Printed Name By F / , \u2014\nTitle v D Brandi T a e trer y2 e ne ri O Yd Wli h e5 4 LL |\nE R m e a g il u A latory Sp d eciali d st Novem r ber 8, 2 e 0 s 1 s 1 PETR OLEUAM E NEN GINEER\nbterry@oasispetroleum.com\nSUNDRY NOTICE@AND REPORTS ON WELLS -\nINDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF NORTH DAKOTA\nOIL-AND GAS DIVISION\nWell File No.\n600 EAST BOULEVARD DEPT 405\n20407\nBISMARCK, ND 58505-0840\nSFN 5749 (08-2006)\nPLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE FILLING OUT FORM.\nPLEASE SUBMIT THE ORIGINAL-AND ONE COPY.\nNotice of Intent Approximate Start Date [] .

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small\ndrilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the\nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of\nthe surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the\ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the\nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The\nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of\nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using\nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the\nterms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing\nor drilling unit for the above-referenced well.

Foley Federal 42-12H [SW SE Section 12,\nT153N, R101W] is located approximately 10 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County,\nNorth Dakota. The Foley Federal 530/ 43-12H is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within the\nWilliston Basin consisting of one ~9,425\u201d long lateral drilled towards the north (360\u00b0). The\nvertical hole was drilled to a depth of 10,257\u2019 measured depth (MD). Plans called for a\n12\u00b0/100\u2019 built rate in the curve to ensure landing within the Middle Bakken silty sandstone.\nTo isolate the targeted reservoir and meet legal requirements, intermediate casing was set\nafter drilling to 11,015\u2019 MD (Figure 2), After intermediate casing had been set, directional\ndrilling and geo-steering techniques were employed to maintain maximum exposure to the\ntarget reservoir.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\n|\n|\nPLAN VIEW\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nFoley 5301 43-12H 10500\n| LT J\nI i Botto L m Hole Loc t atio n: \" }0000\n| T 9,918.59\" N& 42.61 W 900\nof surface location of approx. 9000\n| 1 275.37 FNL & 1,869.61\" FEL 8800\ni L | i Lot 1 Sec. 1, T153N, RIOWW ion\nwet +) 0 th | ng\n| aa | +\u2014} 7000\ni!

They were the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Bray 5301 43-12H [SW SE Sec.\n12, TIS3N, R101W], located 100\u2019 west of the subject well; SM Energy Company Lindvig 1-\n71HR [SE SE Sec. 11, T153N, R101W], located 0.8 miles west of the subject well; and the\nSM Energy Company Rosebud 22-11 [SE NW Sec. 11, T153N, R101W], located 1.45 miles\nnorthwest of the subject well (Figure 3). The above wells were selected based on their\nproximity to the subject well. Data including rate of penetration (ROP), and lagged samples\nwere used to determine marker and formation tops during the vertical hole. MWD gamma\nray data was utilized during the curve build and lateral sections. During both the vertical and\ncurve-build sections, tops were compared to primary offset wells to ensure successful landing\nwithin the target zone. The true vertical depth (TVD) of the landing target was calculated by\nassuming comparable formation thicknesses to the closest offset wells, the Bray 530] 43-\n12H and Lindvig 1-11HR. Target was adjusted as necessary until landing (Table 1). |\nSUNBURST __\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\n*\nROSESUD 22-11\n11\n| +\nPALUER 11-11\n*\nUNDMIG \u00a311.50\nBRAY \u00a3301 63-124\nFigure 3.

On September 13, 2011 an 8\n%\u201d Smith PDC MDSI616 bit (bit #2) was used in front of a 1.5\u00b0 fixed mud motor to re-enter\nthe vertical hole with 5\u201d drill pipe. This assembly drilled 8,157\u2019 to kick-off point (KOP) at\n10,257\u2019 MD in 97 hours using diesel invert drilling fluid with a density of 9.5-9.9 pounds per\ngallon (ppg). KOP was reached at 13:30 hours CDT September 15, 2011.\nCurve Build\n4\nCurve building started September 16, 2011 at 10,257\u2019 MD. Diesel invert drilling fluid\nfluctuated in density between 10.3 and 10.5 ppg. The curve was drilled with a Security PDC\nFXDSSM bit, (bit #3), in front of a 2.5\u00b0 fixed mud motor. Drilling progressed efficiently with\nthis assembly until total depth (TD) of the curve was reached at 11,015\u2019 MD at 0900 CDT on\nSeptember 17, 2011. The bottom hole assembly (BHA) included a Professional Directional\nMWD tool that recorded survey and gamma ray data. The wellbore successfully penetrated\nthe Middle Bakken silty sandstone target at 10,976\u2019 MD (10,732\u2019 TVD, -8,641\u2019 MSL). The\ndrill string and BHA were tripped out of the hole while laying down the 5\u201d drill pipe using a\nlay-down crew. Casing operations were performed by Wyoming Casing Services Inc. The 7\u201d\nintermediate casing consisted of 208 joints of 294 HCP-110 and 66 joints of 324# HCP-110.\nCementing operations were performed by Schlumberger.\nLateral\na\nAfter intermediate casing procedures were completed, 4\u201d drill pipe was picked up, diesel\ninvert drilling fluid was replaced with salt water drilling fluid which fluctuated in density\nfrom 9.2-9.5+ ppg throughout the lateral. Bit #4, a 6\u201d Security PDC FX64 was run in front\nof a 1.5\u00b0 fixed motor. Drilling progressed efficiently until 12,4177 MD when the wellbore\nencountered the Upper Bakken Shale after a violent bounce upward where two downward\nslides did not remediate the ascension of the bit. The decision was made to open-hole\nsidetrack starting at 12,041\u2019 MD. The first attempt at sidetracking was successful; however\nthe MWD tool failed necessitating a trip. The mud motor was replaced with another 1.5\u00b0\nfixed motor in front of a 6\u201d Security PDC FX64, (bit #5).

Sunburst installed and monitored a digital gas\ndetector and chromatograph interfaced with a Pason Electronic Data Recording System\n(EDR). The EDR provided depth, drilling rate and pump stroke data to the M-Controller gas-\nmonitoring software which returned gas data in the form of total gas units and hydrocarbon\nconstituent (methane, ethane, propane, butane) concentrations expressed in parts-per-million.\nGas samples were pulled through 4\u201d poly-flow tubing after agitation in Sunburst\u2019s gas trap\ninstalled in the possum belly. Rig crews caught lagged samples under the supervision of\nwell-site geologists in 30\u2019 intervals from 8,240\u2019 to 10,820\u2019; 10\u00b0 intervals from 10,820\u201d to\n11,020\u2019; 30\u00b0 intervals from 11,020\u2019 to 20,440\u2019 TD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined\nunder a binocular microscope, complete lithologic descriptions are provided in this }\nevaluation. Cuttings were also evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d by immersion in Entron and\ninspected under a UV fluoroscope until samples became contaminated with lateral lubricant\nat approximately 14,600\u2019 MD. One set of dry cuttings were collected and sent to the North\nDakota Geological Survey Core Library.\nLithology |\nGeologic evaluation began at 8,240\u2019 in orange to orange brown siltstone with trace amount of |\nwhite to off white sandstone in the Mississippian Kibbey Formation (Big Snowy Group).\nThe Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d Marker was logged at 8,536\u2019 TVD (-6,265 MSL, 1\u201d low to the Bray\n5301 43-12H offset). The top of the Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d was determined based off a decrease in\nrate of penetration (ROP), due to a 14\u201d layer of anhydrite. Samples from this interval are\nmostly light gray to brown lime mudstone with a crystalline texture. Below the Kibbey\n\u201cLime\u201d marker samples consist of interbedded white to off white calcareous shale and orange\nbrown to brown calcareous siltstone.\nUnconformably below the Kibbey is the Mississippian Charles Formation (Madison Group).\nSamples from this interval were primarily salt which was translucent to a milky white color\nand typically consisted of firm to hard subhedral crystals, inter-bedded with argillaceous\nlimestone and anhydrite. The lime mudstone was firm to friable, crystalline and primarily\nlight to medium gray to gray-brown in color. The anhydrite was white, soft, and amorphous\nin texture. The Charles Salt was logged here at 8,490\u2019 TVD (-6,399\u2019 MSL, 4\u00b0 high to Bray\nSUNBURST\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\n5301 43-12H offset). Intermittent salt beds were present until the Base Last Salt Marker\n(Charles Formation), logged at 9,198\u2019 TVD (-7,107\u2019 MSL, 0\u00b0 to the Bray 5301 43-12H and\n2\u2019 low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). Within the salts, the UB Marker was penetrated at\n9,120\u2019 TVD (-7,029\" MSL 6\u2019 low to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 0\u00b0 to the Lindvig 1-11HR\noffsets). The Ratcliffe interval is a lower member of the Charles Formation found below the\nBase Last Salt. The Ratcliffe was logged at 9,230\u2019 TVD (-7,139\u00b0 MSL 0\u00b0 to the Bray 5301\n43-12H offset).\nThe Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian Madison Group) was penetrated at 9,418\u201d\nTVD (-7,327 MSL, 2\u2019 low to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 0\u201d to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets).\nThis formation consists predominately of limestone with poor intercrystalline porosity and an\nearthy texture. The lime mudstone is typically; medium to dark gray, microcrystalline, firm\nand contained sections that are partially argillaceous. Trace quantities of anhydrite were also\nobserved, that were white to off white, soft and amorphous.\nThe Lodgepole Formation (Mississippian Madison Group) was encountered at 9,975\u2019 TVD (-\n7,884\u2019 MSL, 3\u2019 high to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 3\u2019 high to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets).\nThe Lodgepole contain some limestone near the top of the formation, but is dominated\nprimarily by an argillaceous lime mudstone with common traces of pyrite. The limestone\nsamples observed were tan, light gray to cream, microcrystalline, earthy texture, and friable\nto firm with no visible porosity is typically described as a light to medium gray to gray-\nbrown dense fossiliferous argillaceous limestone with some chert present.\nThe \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d Marker (Mississippian Lodgepole Formation) was logged at 10,815'\nMD, 10,692\u2019 TVD (-8,601' MSL, 0\u00b0 to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 6\u2019 low to the Lindvig 1-\n11HR offsets) Typically, The False Bakken facies consisted of very dark gray carbonaceous\nshale that is soft to friable with an earthy texture. There is usually common disseminated\npyrite and no visible porosity.\nThe Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation is comprised of two beds of black\ncarbonaceous petroliferous shale bounding a silty sandstone Middle Member with some\nintergranular porosity. The Upper Shale Member was logged at 10,832\u2019 MD, 10,703' TVD (-\n8,612\u2019 MSL, 0\u2019 to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 9\u2019 low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). Sample\nreturns were black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale with common disseminated pyrite\nand characterized by gamma ray values in excess of ~300 API counts.\nThe Middle Bakken Member was logged at 10,876\u2019 MD, 10,719' TVD (-8,628\u2019 MSL, 0\u201d to\nthe Bray 5301 43-12H and 7\u2019 low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). This member is typically\ncomprised of three distinct lithologies. The first facies encountered was a siltstone\ncharacterized by a high gamma signature. This lithology is located directly below the Upper\nShale Member. A typical description of this zone is a well to moderately sorted dark gray to\ngray siltstone with possible intergranular porosity.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nFigure 4. Middle Bakken siltstone. Sample depth 10,930\u2019 MD viewed under 20x magnification. (Kyle Kavalec,\nSunburst well-site geologist)\nThe second distinct lithology of the Middle Bakken Member was a fossiliferous limestone\n(packstone) with a characteristically low gamma signature ~20 API units. It has a variable\nthickness throughout the Williston Basin and lies directly below the siltstone; however this\nfacies was absent in the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H.\nThe third lithology of the Middle Bakken Member is silty sandstone usually located below\nthe packstone. The lithologic description is a light gray to off white to cream with trace\nmedium gray silty sandstone that is very fine grained to fine grained. This silty sandstone is\nmoderately sorted with dolomite and calcite cements. In zone a spotty to even oil stain was\npresent.\nThe top of this zone exhibited a higher gamma signature than the bottom portion. At the top\n1\u2019-2\u2019 of zone gamma signatures ranged from 100\u2019s to 120\u2019s. The middle 1\u2019-2\u2019 of the zone\nexhibited a lower gamma count ~60 API units. The lower portion of zone displayed counts\nin the 90\u2019s to 100\u2019s with very little character. The oil staining observed in sample displayed\nsimilar concentrations throughout the target zone. Within the zone oil stain was described as\ncommon to trace light brown spotty to even.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nFigure 5.

Increased background gas\nconcentrations were most likely due to greater exposure of the wellbore to the target porosity\nzone in addition to a lighter mud weight. The highest peak values were observed towards the\nsecond half of the lateral while drilling in the upper portion of the target zone. The highest\npeak value observed was 4,477 units at 17,252\u2019 MD with a mud weight of 10.5 ppg.\nConnection gases within the target zone averaged ~500-2,000 units in the beginning of the\nlateral and increased to ~3,000-4,000 units towards the end. The highest connection gas\nobserved throughout the lateral was 1,539 units at 16,988\u2019 MD. Gas was circulated through\nthe gas buster throughout the second half of the lateral following a 3,000 unit gas peak during\nthe middle of the lateral. The Middle Bakken trip gas was the highest trip gas value of 6,421\nunits observed throughout the well. Light brown spotty oil stain was observed throughout the\ntarget zone lithology. Oil stained samples were immersed in Entron. The samples exhibited\npredominantly moderate diffuse pale yellow to green fluorescence. As the samples became\ncontaminated with lateral lubricant they were not longer evaluated for hydrocarbon cut due to\nfact that the lubricant fluid is hydrocarbon based which would cause false fluorescence in the\nsample and thus give an inaccurate picture of the amount of hydrocarbons present within the\ncuttings. Greenish brown oil was observed coming over the shakers the entire lateral.\nThroughout the lateral sidetrack a 4-8\u2019 intermittent flare was observed.\nGeo-steering\nProfessional Directional provided well site supervision. Professional Directional was utilized\nfor directional drilling services and for MWD services. Oasis\u2019 office in Houston, directional\ndrillers and Sunburst geologists worked closely throughout the well to make steering\ndecisions to maximize the amount of borehole exposure to the pay zone. The Middle Bakken\nMember of the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is estimated at ~36\u2019 thick. The initial target\ninterval chosen for this well was located 7\u2019 below the upper shale at 10,732\u2019 TVD. After two\nUpper Bakken Shale strikes from wild bounces near the top of the zone and the tendency of\nthe mud motor to build heavily in rotation our target interval dropped to 13\u2019 below the Upper\nBakken Shale. This was for preventing anymore \u201chard streaks\u201d from bouncing the wellbore\nup and out of the zone. The original target zone was chosen based on density porosity logs\nfrom other wells. Stratigraphic location within the target zone was based on gamma ray\nvalues, sample observations, gas shows, and drill rates. Gamma signatures at the very top of\ntarget zone ranged in value from ~100-120 API units. The middle of the target gamma\nsignatures were consistently in the 60\u2019s. Upon descent into the lower portion of the target,\ngamma values observed averaged ~90 API units with very little character. The lowest\ngamma lithology was encountered when crossing the center target zone at roughly 12,226\u2019\nMD in the lateral. The presence of repeatable gamma markers provided excellent\nmechanisms for steering. A dip calculation along the length of the well bore indicated an\noverall 0.26\u00b0 down formation apparent dip.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\n~ A GEOLOGY SERVICE\nDIP PROFILE\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nFoley 5301 43-120\n\u2014 200\nOver p 025,\neraG\nFigure 7.

Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is a |\ncontinuation of exploratory efforts in McKenzie County, North Dakota targeting the\nMiddle Bakken porosity within the Miss.-Devonian Bakken Formation\n2) The well was spud on July 27, 2011 and re-entered September 13, 2011. The vertical\nhole was drilled to a kick-off point of 10,257\u2019 on September 15, 2011. Intermediate\ncasing was set at 10,995\u2019 MD in preparation for lateral operations. Lateral drilling\noperations concluded on October 6, 2011.\n3) The lateral was drilled with four 6\u201d PDC bits.\n4) A diesel invert mud program was used through the vertical and curve. Salt water\ndrilling fluid was used for the remainder of drilling operations. The weight of both\nfluids was (~9.5-10.6 ppg) to maintain hydrostatic balance.\n5) Samples from the Middle Bakken porosity consisted of silty sandstone and very fine\ngrained to fine grained sandstone with dolomite and calcite cement in part.\nSUNBURST\nCONSULTING\nas A GEOLOGY SERVICE\n6) Hydrocarbon shows in the Middle Bakken were very common. Samples containing\noil stain fluoresced when immersed in Entron producing moderate to diffuse\nbecoming streaming green to yellow fluorescence. Gas shows reached a peak value\nof ~4,477 units at 17,252\u201d MD.\n7) Geo-steering was accomplished via sample evaluation and gamma markers. Dip\nestimations were based on intersections with repeat markers by the well bore. Dip\nprojections were utilized to maintain contact between the well bore and the target\nporosity zones.\n8) The Foley Federal 5301 43-12H awaits completion operations to determine its\nultimate production potential.\nRespectfully submitted,\nKyle Kavalec\nC/0 Sunburst Consulting, Inc\n& October 2011\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nsd WELL DATA SUMMARY\nOPERATOR: Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nADDRESS: 1001 Fannin, Suite 1500\nHouston, TX 77002\nWELL NAME: Foley Federal 5301 43-12H\nAPL#: 33-053-03608\nWELL FILE #: 20863\nSURFACE LOCATION: 250\u2019 FSL & 1,827\u00b0 FEL\nSW SE Section 12, T153N-R101W\nFIELD/ PROSPECT; Wildcat / Bakken\nCOUNTY, STATE McKenzie County, North Dakota\nBASIN:\n@ WELL TYPE; Middle Bakken Horizontal\nELEVATION: GL: 2,074\"\nKB: 2,091\"\nRE-ENTRY DATE: September 8, 2011\nBOTTOM HOLE LOCATION: 9,918.59\" North & 42.61\" West of surface location or approx.\n275.37' FNL & 1869.61\" FEL, Lot 1 Section 1, T153N-R101W\nCLOSURE COORDINATES: Closure Direction Azimuth: 359.75\u00b0\nClosure Distance: 9,918.68\"\nTOTAL DEPTH / DATE: 20,440\u2019 at 0430 Hrs CDT on 6 October 2011\n82% within target interval\nTOTAL DRILLING DAYS: 28 days\nSTATUS OF WELL: Open-hole completion/ preparing to open-hole frac\nCONTRACTOR: Xtreme #17\n@\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nPUMPS: Gardner PZ-11 (Stroke Length 11\")\nTOOLPUSHERS;: Brandon Clampitt, David Bowlby\nFIELD SUPERVISORS: Wade Larmer, Bruce Jorgenson\nCHEMICAL COMPANY: National Oilwell Varco\nPrairie Petro-Chem of America\nMUD ENGINEER: Nate Joseph\nMUD TYPE: Oil based Mud; Salt water\nMUD LOSSES: Invert Mud: 514 bbls, Salt Water: 0 bbis\nPR ECT H Andy Nelson and John Gillespie\nWELLSITE GEOLOGISTS: Kyle Kavalec, Nathan Gabelman\nGEOSTEERING SYSTEM: Sunburst Digital Wellsite Geological System\nROCK SAMPLING: 30\u2019 from 8,240'-10,820', 11,020\u2019 - 20,440' (TD)\n10\u00b0 from 10,820'-11,020\u00b0\n\u2018SAMPLE EXAMINATION: Binocular microscope & fluoroscope\nSAMPLE CUTS: Entron\nGAS DETECTION: Mudlogging Systems Model TGC, Serial #: ML-169\nDIRECTION, ERS: Professional Directional\nMike Dibble, Nate Linde\nMWD: Professional Directional\nJohn Capra, Tim Pile\nSurface: 9 5/8\" 52 JTS 36# J-55 set to 2,085'\nIntermediate: 7\" 208 JTS 29% HCP-110, 66 JTS 32# HCP-110\nset to 10,995\"\nSUNBURST \u2014\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nBray 5301 43-12H\nSW SE Sec. 12, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nSM Energy Company\nLindvig 1-11HR:\nSE SE Sec. 11, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nSM Energy Company\nRoseBud 22-11\nSE NW Sec. 11, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\nGolden Eye Resources, LLC\n5460 South Quebec Street, Suite 335\nGreenwood Village, CO 80111\n303-832-1994 (phone)\nNorth Dakota Industrial Commission\nOil and Gas Division\n600 East Boulevard Ave, Dept. 405\nBismarck, ND 58505-0840\nHunt Oil and Gas\n1900 N.

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small\ndrilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the\nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of\nthe surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the\ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the\nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The\nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of\nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using\nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the\nterms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing\nor drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding\nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well\npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if\nthe well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.\nCompany Telephone Number\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC 281.404.9488 FOR STATE USE ONLY\nA 4001 Fannin, S d uite 1 d 5 r 0 e 0 ss L] Re . ceived PX Approved\nC Houston i o ty a S T tat M e Zip C o 7 d 7 e 00 Da 2 te V/ 1d / \\\\\nSwiy gAwn |a ; |t \\ - PLrainuterda NStraomnge O By 2e 7 h4 K-19 \u2014\nTitle / Date\nDr a illing e E n : gineer May 11, 2011 Title \u2018 V W W L\nEmail Address Mineral Regources Permit Manager\nLstrong@oasispetroleum.com\nINDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF NORTH DAKOTA\nOIL AND GAS DIVISION\n(\n600 EAST BOULEVARD DEPT 405 20863\nBISMARCK, ND 58505-0840\n\u2018SFN 5749 (09-2006)\nPLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE FILLING OUT FORM\nPLEASE SUBMIT THE ORIGINAL AND ONE COPY.\nNotice of Intent Approximate Start Date (1 Drilling Prognosis (1 Spill Report\nJune 30, 2041 1 Redritiing or Repair \u00a9) shooting\n(1) Report of Work Done Date Work Completed (1) Casing or Liner C1 Acidizing\n(2) Plug Well () Fracture Treatment\nLF Notice of intent to Begin a Workover Project that may Qualify (1) Supplemental History (Change Production Method\nfor a Tax Exemption Pursuant to NDCC Section 57-51.1-03 or 1y Aband 7 Reclamati\nApproximate Stan Date \u2018emporarily Abandon 1) Reclamation\n(4) Other Offsite Battery\n[Well Name and Number 24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE\nFoley Federal 5301 43-12H Before After\nFootages Qtr-Qtr\u2014|Section Township Range Oil Bbis [Oil Bbis\n250 F SL 1827 F_E L| SWSE 12 153 N 101 W Water Bbis |Water Bbis\nField Pool (County Gas MCF |Gas MCE\nWildcat Bakken McKenzie\nName of Contractor(s)\nAddress city State Zip Code\nDETAILS OF WORK\nOasis Petroleum respectfully request to build an offsite tank battery in the SESW of Section 12 T153N R101W (plat\nattached).

If circumstances require operations to\ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may\nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information\nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other\ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the\ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested\nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the\nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal\nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.

Surveys\nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may\nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the\noperation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe\ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.\nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.\nReserve pit\nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on\nthis site if specific site conditions warrant.\nSurface casing cement\nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12\nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi\nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.\nLogs\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of\ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma\nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as\none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image\nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced\nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to\nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a\nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its\nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5\u201d floppy diskette, a standard\nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov\nThank you for your cooperation.\nSincerely,\nNathaniel

The well is part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s Williston Basin drilling program, targeting the\nMiddle Bakken with two section laterals and utilizing the latest technology in fracture\nstimulation completions. The well was permitted for a 10,086\u201d lateral drilling south 1,927\u2019 from\nthe east line of sections 12, 13 and 24. Directional tools will kick-off from the vertical hole in the\nLodgepole Formation, build a curve and land in the Middle Bakken target zone. The proposed\nlateral would be geo-steered within the ideal target rock, focusing on a higher porosity zone |\napproximately 8 feet from the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. The lateral will be directed\nalong an azimuth of 180\u00b0 to a TD approximately 200\u00b0 from the south line in the SW % of SE \u201c j\nSection 24.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\n\u2014 = A GEOLOGY SERVICE\nOFFSET INFORMATION\nThree previously completed wells were used as the main offsets to assist in landing the curve\nbuild section of the Bray 5301 43-12H. The Lindvig /-/1H, initially completed as a vertical well,\nwas drilled on December 12, 1981 and was then re-entered on February 17, 2008 and completed\nas a horizontal well, located approximately 0.80 miles west of Bray 5301 43-12H in [Sec. 11,\nTIS3N, RIOIW]. The Lindvig 1-/1HR was initially drilled to produce both the Red River\nFormation (dry to date) and the Madison Group (producing 201,159 Bbls of oil to date). Lindvig\n1-11 HR was then re-entered and completed as a single section lateral, to focus production in the\nMississippian Nesson interval (approximately -7,321\u2019 subsea). The initial completion of the\nlateral showed an increase in production from approximately 200 Bbls of oil a month to 1,600\nBbls of oil a month, which has since tapered off to 400 Bbls of oil a month as of August, 2011.\nThe SM Energy Company Rosebud 22-11 [Sec. 11, T153N, R101 W] is a vertical well targeting\nthe Red River Formation (199,061 Bbls of oil). This well was drilled on September 21, 1985 and\nis located 1.45 miles northwest of Bray 5301 43-12H. The third offset well is the Earthstone\nEnergy Edwin M. Dahl 23-|, which is a vertical well targeting the Red River Formation\n(producing 26,011 Bbls of oil to date) and the Madison Group (producing 113,393 Bbls of oil to\ndate). Edwin M. Dahl 23-1 was drilled on June 29, 1980 and is located 2.50 miles southwest of\nBray 5301 43-12H in Section 23. The gamma ray signatures through the lower Lodgepole and\nBakken observed in the SM Energy Company Lindvig 1-1 1HR provided the best correlation with\nthe MWD gamma ray observed during operations, and provided formation thicknesses consistent\nwith what was observed on Bray 5301 43-12H. Complete tops data are included as an appendix\nto this report.\nENGINEERING\nProfessional Directional LTD, provided equipment and personnel for measurement-while-\ndrilling (MWD) and directional drilling services. Sunburst Consulting geologists worked closely\nthroughout the project with Professional Directional personnel to make steering decisions to\nmaximize the amount of borehole in the pay zone\nSpud\nThe Bray 5301 43-12H was initially spud on July 24, 2011, with a Reed 13 %\u201d tri-cone surface\nbit (bit #1). Bit #1 was used to drill the surface hole with fresh water and drilled 2,040\u201d in 49\nhours, reaching the initial surface casing depth on July 25, 2011. The hole was then sealed to be\nre-entered on August 27, 2011.\nRe-Entry: Vertical |\nBray 5301 43-12H was then re-entered on August 27, 2011 with a Security 8 %\u201d PDC bit (bit\n#2). Bit #2 was used to drill out of surface casing with a 1.50\u00b0 Hunting LS fixed motor in invert\ndrilling fluid with a weight between 9.5-9.7 pound per gallon (ppg), with 5\u201d drill pipe. This\nassembly drilled 8,080\u2019 in 79.5 hours to kick-off point (KOP) at 10,220\u2019 MD, and then was\ntripped out on September 02, 2011 to be replaced with the curve assembly.\nSUNBURST\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nCurve\nCurve building started September 03, 2011 at 10,220\u2019 MD (KOP). Diesel invert drilling fluid\nfluctuated in density between 10.48 and 10.6 ppg. The curve bottom hole assembly (BHA)\nconsisted of a Security 8 %4\u201d bit (bit #3) and a 2.5\u00b0 Professional Direction LS fixed mud motor.\nThe BHA also included a Professional Directional MWD tool that recorded survey and gamma\nray data. This assembly drilled the entire curve of 862\u2019 in 13 hours, achieving exceptional build\nrates and landing the curve 12 feet into the Middle Bakken Member, reaching the curve TD of\n11,082\u2019 MD (10,734\u2019 TVD). The drill string and BHA were tripped out of the hole while laying\ndown the 5\u201d drill pipe using a lay-down crew. Casing operations were performed by Wyoming\nCasing Services Inc. The 7\u201d intermediate casing consisted of 182 joints of 294 HCP-110 and 64\njoints of 32# HCP-110 set to 11,0717 MD. Cementing operations were then performed by\nSchlumberger.\nLateral\nAfter intermediate casing procedures were completed, 4\u201d drill pipe was picked up, diesel invert\ndrilling fluid was replaced with salt water drilling fluid which fluctuated in density from 10.2-\n10.6 ppg throughout the lateral. The first lateral BHA consisted of a 6\u201d Smith PDC bit (bit #4),\nwith a Hunting LS 1.5 degree bend motor and a gamma tool 37\u2019 from the bit. This assembly\ndrilled to 15,562\u2019 MD in 55 hours before a trip was required to replace the motor. The next\nassembly consisted of a 6\u201d Smith PDC bit (bit #4); with a Hunting LS 1.5 degree bend motor and\na gamma tool 37\u2019 from the bit. This final BHA reached TD at 20,978\u2019 taking 76 hours. The\nwellbore reached a planned total depth (TD) on October 22, 2011 at 1230 CDT, with a bottom\nhole location at 10,478.70' south & 2.05' east of surface location or approximately 308.07' FSL\n& 1,924.95' FEL, SW SE Section 24, T153N, R101W.\nGEOLOGIC EVALUATION\nMethods\nTwo well-site geologists contracted by Sunburst Consulting Inc. conducted the geologic analysis\nfor Bray 5301 43-12H. Sunburst installed and monitored a digital gas detector and\nchromatograph interfaced with a Pason Electronic Data Recording System (EDR). The EDR\nprovided depth, drilling rate and pump stroke data to the M-Controller gas-monitoring software\nwhich returned gas data in the form of total gas units and hydrocarbon constituent (methane,\nethane, propane, butane) concentrations expressed in parts-per-million. Gas samples were pulled\nthrough '4\u201d poly-flow tubing after agitation in Sunburst\u2019s gas trap installed in the possum belly.\nRig crews caught lagged samples under the supervision of well-site geologists in 30\u00b0 intervals\nfrom 8,240\u2019 to 10,880\u2019; 10\u00b0 intervals from 10,880\u2019 to 11,090\u2019; 30\u00b0 intervals from 11,090\u2019 to\n20,960\u2019. Wet and dry cuttings were examined under a binocular microscope, complete lithologic\ndescriptions are provided in this evaluation. Cuttings were also evaluated for hydrocarbon \u201ccut\u201d\nby immersion in Entron and inspected under a UV fluoroscope until samples became\ncontaminated with lateral lubricant at approximately 15,300\u2019 MD. One set of dry cuttings were\ncollected and sent to the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nLithology and Hydrocarbon Shows\nGeologic evaluation began at 8,240\u2019 in orange to orange brown siltstone with trace amount of\nwhite to off white sandstone in the Kibbey Formation. The Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d was drilled at 8,355\u00b0\n(-6,261\"), coming in 3\u2019 low to Lindvig 1-11HR and was determined based off a decrease in rate\nof penetration (ROP), due to a 16\u00b0 layer of anhydrite. Samples from this interval are mostly light\ngray to brown lime mudstone with a crystalline texture. Below the Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d marker\nsamples consist of orange brown to brown calcareous siltstone. No significant shows were\nobserved in the Kibbey.\nFigure 1: Photograph of limestone from Kibbey Formation.\nThe First Charles Salt was penetrated at 8,494\u2019 (-6,400\u2019) and came in even to Lindvig 1-11HR,\nbased off ROP breaks. The Base of the Last Charles Salt was drilled at 9,198\u2019 (-7,104\u2019), 1\u2019 high\nto Lindvig 1-11HR. Samples from this interval were primarily salt which was translucent to a\nmilky white color and typically consisting of firm to hard subhedral crystals, inter-bedded with\nargillaceous limestone and anhydrite. The lime mudstone was firm to friable, crystalline and\nprimarily light to medium gray to gray-brown in color. The anhydrite was white, soft, and\namorphous in texture.\nFigure 2: Photograph of limestone, salt, anhydrite, and dolomite in Charles Formation.\n|\n\\\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nThe Ratcliffe Interval was penetrated at 9,230\u00b0 (-7,136\u2019), 1\u2019 high to Lindvig 1-11HR. This\nformation consists of dolomitic mudstone, anhydrite, and limestone that were argillaceous in\nsections. The observed tan, light to medium gray brown dolomite was microcrystalline, firm, and\ncontained a chalky to earthy texture. The anhydrite was a white to off white color, with a\nmicrocrystalline texture, and was soft and amorphous. The tan, light to medium gray brown\nargillaceous lime mudstone-wackestone described was microcrystalline, firm, with an earthy\ntextured and exhibited no visible porosity. This section can contain a significant amount of oil\nand gas, and was particularly productive in the offset well Lindvig 1-1/HR. The cuttings and\nmud gas analysis by a total gas chromatograph, however, did not log productive shows suspected\nover this interval. These shows, however, were present within the lower unit of the Mississippian\nMadison Group, the Mission Canyon Formation.\nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was penetrated at 9,416\u2019\n(-7,322\u2019), 5\u00b0 high to Lindvig 1-11HR. This formation consists predominately of limestone with\npoor intercrystalline porosity and an earthy texture. The lime mudstone was typically medium to\ndark gray, microcrystalline, firm and contained sections that were partially argillaceous. Traces\nof anhydrite were also observed, that were white to off white, soft and amorphous. There was\ntrace spotty dark brown oil staining observed in cuttings, which was highlighted by a gas show\nof 107 units, present in the limestone unit.\nThe Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was drilled at 9,978\u2019 (-7,884\u00b0), 3\u00b0\nhigh to Lindvig 1-1/ HR. The Lodgepole contains some limestone near the top of the formation,\nbut was dominated primarily by an argillaceous lime mudstone with common traces of pyrite.\nThe limestone samples are tan, light gray to cream, microcrystalline, earthy texture, and friable\nto firm with no visible porosity or oil show.\nSUNBURST\nONSULTING\nA GECLOGY SERVICE\nomy \u2014 s\nFigure 4: Photograph of limestone from the Lodgepole Formation.\nThe \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d was penetrated at 10,692\u2019 TVD (-8,598\u2019), 3\u00b0 low to Lindvig 1-11HR. The\nFalse Bakken in this area is particularly thin, and was not observed in the cuttings. The False\nBakken consists of very dark gray carbonaceous shale. Fracture porosity was observed though,\npresent in a gas spike of up to 4000 units, which is typical of the False Bakken.\nThe Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at 10,703\u2019 TVD (-8,609\"), 6\u00b0 low to Lindvig 1-11HR.\nSample returns were black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale with common disseminated\npyrite and characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 300 API counts.\nFigure 5: Photograph of black carbonaceous Upper Bakken Shate, disptaying disseminated pyrite. |\nThe Bakken Middle Member was penetrated at 10,719\u2019 TVD (-8,625\u2019), 4\u2019 low to Lindvig 1- |\n11HR. The middle member is topped by dense, dark gray siltstone with poor intergranular\nporosity. The bit was landed at 10,732\u2019 TVD, near the center of the target interval.\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nFigure 6: Photograph of sample from the target zone of the Middle Bakken.\nThe target zone within the Middle Bakken was determined during a casing point meeting prior\nto horizontal drilling operations. The desired target zone was primarily chosen off of data\nprovided by the Lindvig /-1/HR offset log. The 12\u00b0 interval shaded in red and yellow in Figure\n7; set 8\u00b0 below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale and the base set at ~14\u2019 above the top of the\nLower Bakken Shale, was defined as the primary target interval. Within the 12\u2019 target zone,\ndrilling was focused on the two high gamma spike (112-120 API) right at the top of target, for\ngeo-steering purposes, and this gamma marked an eight foot high porosity zone at the top of\ntarget labeled and shaded in yellow in Figure 7. The eight foot zone was distinguishable in\ncuttings as silty sandstone, having moderate calcite cement, abundant in light to medium brown\ncolor, spotty to even brown oil staining and occasional light to medium gray color. Directly\nbelow this zone was well cemented light gray to medium gray silty sandstone, which showed\noccasional spotty brown oil staining. Above the eight foot high porosity zone consisted of\nmoderately cemented medium to light gray silty sandstone occasional medium to light brown\nand common dark gray in color, with occasional spotty brown oil staining.\nSy 4 F\n+\nE\n+\n+\n* 7 iF\nS iF\n+ x +\n==\n= +\nT PEP t\nFigure 7: Middle Bakken target zone gamma ray and porosity profile detailed in the Lindvig 1-11HR log\nRate of penetration in the targeted Middle Bakken averaged 100-150 fV/hr while drilling early in\nthe lateral.

Background gas concentrations observed in the Middle Bakken\nlateral ranged from approximately 600 units during the curve and at the beginning of lateral with\na 10.0 ppg mud weight with shows in the mid 2,500 units. Towards the end of the lateral\nbackground gas increased to an excess of 3,000 units with shows in excess of 5,000 units with a\n10.8 ppg mud weight. Increased background gas concentrations were witnessed during intervals\nof high apparent formation dips. These intervals of high dips were between 13,950\u2019 MD and\n14,350\u2019 MD where the dip averaged 0.8 degrees down and then again between 15,750\u2019 MD and\n20,975\u2019 MD where the dip averaged 1.0 degrees up. This increase in gas is likely due to\nincreased fracture porosity, caused by fracturing within the rock from the strain caused by these\ndeformations or a local structural trap. The highest peak value observed was nearly 7,144 units\nat 20,673\u2019 MD with a mud weight of 10.5 ppg. Connection gases within the target zone\naveraged ~1,500-2,000 units in the beginning of the lateral to ~4,000-6,000 units towards the\nend. Greenish brown oil was observed coming over the shakers and within the sample cuttings\nthroughout the entire lateral. When sample cuttings were submerged in Entron, they emitted a\nslow to very slow diffuse green fluorescence. Entron submersion was then halted once samples\nbecame contaminated with lube. Throughout the lateral a 1-8\u2019 intermittent flare was observed,\nr ) and at points could reach up to 25\u2019, as portrayed in Figure 9.\nSUNBURST |\nCONSULTING\n\u2014 - A GEOLOGY SERVICE\nFigure 9: 25\" trip flare observed during tripping operations.\nGeo-steering\nThe target zone within the Bakken Middle Member was established using the density porosity\nlogs from the aforementioned offset wells. A 12\u2019 zone in the Lindvig I-11 HR offset well set the\nbasis for the choice of target interval in the Bray 5301 43-12H project (Figure 7). This 12\u00b0\nsection was 8\u2019 below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale and 16\u00b0 above the Lower Bakken\nShale. The target displayed two peaks of high gamma (112-120 API), one at the center of target,\nthe other at the top of target. Low gamma points that established points just below the center of\ntarget and bottom of the target zone. Within the 12\u2019 zone, particular efforts were made to stay in\nthe top eight feet of the target zone which correlated to the high porosity displayed in the Lindvig\n1-11HR electric logs. The well plan was to land in the center of the Middle Bakken target\ninterval to allow maximum exposure to the target porosity. To accommodate the planned liner i\nrun, severe doglegs were to be avoided to obtain the desired vertical section.\nKick off point for the curve was changed to 10,220\u2019 based off the observed thickness to target |\nfrom the Base Last Salt marker. The represented targets are below in Table |. At this point the\nBase Last Salt was the most consistent marker throughout the offset wells, allowing for a raise of\nthe target depth approximately 8 feet. This changed the proposed target landing to 10,724\u2019 TVD,\nwhich remained consistent throughout the vertical hole. Throughout the curve the target |\napproximation remained overly consistent, but began to drop as lower Lodgepole markers were\nlogged. As the lower Lodgepole markers were observed the target landing was moved to 10,730\u2019\nTVD to account for this thickening to target. Once the Upper Bakken Shale top was reached, the\nlanding point was one foot lower to the initial prognosis. The target landing point was then\nchange back to its initial prognosis of 10,732\u2019 TVD, allowing for the curve build to safely land\nthe borehole into the Middle Bakken Member, at approximately 90 degrees to begin the lateral.\n{\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\n\u2014= A GEOLOGY SERVICE\n|\nTARGET PROXIMATION\nFormation/ Zone: Proposed Top of Target From:\nLindvig1- RoseBud Edwin. \u2014_Averago of |\n14HR 22-11 Dahi 23-1 Offset Wells |\nKibbey \u201cLime\u201d 10,730\" 10,716 10,726\" 10,724\"\nFirst Charles Salt 10,727\" 10,709\" 10,723\" 10,720\"\nuB 10,724\" 10,715 10,728\" 10,722\"\nBase Last Sait 10,726 10,719 10,727' 10,724\"\nRatcliffe 10,726\" 10,719' 10,726\" 10,724\"\nMission Canyon 10,722\" 10,708\" 10,725\u00b0 10,718\"\nLodgepole 10,724\" 10,721\" 10,724\" 10,723\"\nLodgepole A 10,724\" 10,718\" 10,726\" 10,723\u00b0\nLodgepole B 10,724\" 10,700\" 10,727\" 10,717\"\nLodgepole C 10,732\" 10,715' 10,727\" 10,725 |\nLodgepole D 10,724 10,716\" 10,726 10,722\"\nLodgepole \u20ac 10,726\" 10,721\" 10,720\" 10,722\"\nLodgepole F 10,727\" 10,724\" 10,731\" 10,727\"\nFalse Bakken 10,730' 10,731\" 10,730\" 10,730\"\nUpper Bakken Shale 10,733\" 10,730\u00b0 10,732\" 10,732\"\nMiddle Bakken 10,731\" 10,730\" 10,731\" 10,731\"\nMiddle Bakken (Target) 10,732) 10,732 10,732\" 10,732\"\nTable 1. Chart used to determine landing target based on formation thicknesses in the offset wells.\nThe wellbore landed at a casing point of 11,082\u2019 MD (10,733\u2019 TVD); approximately 14\u00b0 TVD\ninto the Middle Bakken Member and 6\u2019 into the target zone. Upon drilling out of casing, build\ntendencies were observed, in that the well bore would build up in rotation, approximately one\ndegree per a hundred feet. Slides were implemented to account for this continuous rotational\nbuilding. Once out of the casing an inclination of 87.7 was accurately determined by the MWD\ntool to replace the initial projected inclination of 90 degrees. The lateral assembly was then\nleveled out to slowly drop in target to obtain the full gamma signature of the targeted zone. By\nusing the cool gamma and hot gamma near the center of target the dip was able to be calculated,\nand was found to be an overall down dip of approximately 0.5 degrees. By steering the well bore\nup and down through this sequence of hot and cold gamma signatures multiple times, reliable dip |\ncalculations were established until 14,250\u2019 MD. After 14,250\u2019 MD the dip of formation turned |\nup placing the wellbore near the base of target. In this stratigraphic section there is a low gamma\nmarker at the base of target followed by ratty high gamma above and below the low gamma\nmarker. Using this sequence of gamma markers the well bore was steered within target to\n19,477\u2019 MD, which showed an overall dip of formation of over 1.0 degrees up. At this point the\nwellbore ascended back up to the center of target where it was steered, using the hot gamma\nmarker at the center of target, to a total depth of 20,978\u2019. Over the entire vertical section of\n10,479\u2019 the overall dip of formation was calculate to be 0.39 degrees up, with the well bore over\n90 percent within the target interval, and 50 percent of the time the well bore was steered within\nthe ideal porosity zone.\nSUNBURS\nCONSULT\n_\u2014 A GEOLOGY SERVICE\nSUMMARY\n) The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Bray 5301 43-12H was drilled to further\ndevelop the Middle Bakken in the northern McKenzie County portion of the Williston\nBasin.\n2) The well was re-entered on August 27, 2011 and the vertical hole was drilled to a kick-\noff point of 10,220\u2019. The well path landed below the Middle Bakken porosity zone at\n10,733\u2019 TVD. Intermediate casing was set at 11,082\u2019 MD in preparation for lateral\noperations. Lateral operations progressed within the Middle Bakken, with very good\nhydrocarbon shows to the final bottom hole location when drilling was completed on |\nOctober 22, 2011.\n3) The mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.6 \u2014 9.8 ppg) from surface casing and\nthrough the curve build, which was successful in maintaining stable hole conditions and\nminimizing washout through the salt intervals. After landing the curve the diesel invert\nmud was replaced with salt brine (10.2 - 10.6 ppg) and was successful in preventing loss\nof pore pressure throughout the lateral.\n4) The lithology of the Middle Bakken target zone is off white to light brown and gray, very\nfine grained sandstone and siltstone with poor to fair intergranular porosity and common |\nto occasional spotty to even brown oil stain. Gas was burned as a 1-8\u2019 intermittent flare\nwhile circulating higher show areas of the formation.\n5) The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Bray 5301 43-12H reached 20,978\u2019 TD on\nOctober 22, 2011, reaching the proposed TD, The well currently awaits completion as\nsuccessful Middle Bakken horizontal oil well.\nRespectfully Submitted, |\nNathan Gabelman }\nC/o Sunburst Consulting, Inc.\nOctober 25, 2011,\nSUNBURST _\nCONSULTING\n= = A GEOLOGY SERVICE\nWELL DATA SUMMARY |\nOPERATO!

Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small\ndrilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the\nApplication for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of\nthe surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the\ncasing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the\nlocation within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The\nundersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of\nSection 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using\nan initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the\nterms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing\nor drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding\nconfidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well\npad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if\nthe well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.\nCompany Telephone Number\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC 281.404.9488 FOR STATE USE ONLY\nAddress .\n4001 Fannin, Suite 1500 L] Received I Approved\nCity State Zip Code Date\nHouston TX 77002 C/r / Woo\nSignafaire ) Printed Name ;\nWeer | on Laura Strong \\ [>\nTi V7 \\ Date Tie!\nDrilling Engineer May 11, 2011\nEmail Address ~oi Resourses Perm Wiccnor\nLstrong@oasispetroleum.com\nOil and @as Division 3S\nLynn D.

The\napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than\nthe 200' setback (per ICO 14498) from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy)\nfrom the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N R101W.\nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal\nof drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field\nInspector. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be\nprovided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property\nof the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO\nNO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location\nconstruction. OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must ensure the pit is not constructed\nin fill dirt.\nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)\nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the\napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to\ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may\nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information\nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other\ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the\ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested\nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the\nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal\nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are\n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.

Surveys\nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may\nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the\noperation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe\ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.\nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.\nReserve pit\nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on\nthis site if specific site conditions warrant.\nSurface casing cement\nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12\nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi\nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.\nLogs\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of\ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma\nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as\none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image\nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced\nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to\nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a\nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its\nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format.

The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet. During\nthe qualifying period, August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017, the well produced at a maximum\nefficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold. The average daily\nproduction from the well was 29.9 barrels of oil per day during this period.\nIt is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a \u201cStripper Well Property\u201d\npursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is\napplicable only to the Bakken Pool in and under said property.\nThe Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the\nmatter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or\nnewly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.\nSincerely,\nDavid J.

Plan view of Dahl 15-11H spacing unit and well path.\nOFFSET WELLS\nThree offset wells were used to estimate formation tops and landing target on Dahl 15-11H.\nThese wells were the SM Energy Co., Lindvig 1-11HR, located 0.38 miles northeast, the SM\nEnergy Co., M&G 14-2HR located 1.18 miles northwest, and the SM Energy Co., Rosebud 22-11\nlocated 0.7 miles northwest. The Lindvig 1-11HR was closest and most helpful in estimating\nMiddle Bakken entry during curve operations.\nENGINEERING\nThe Dahl 15-11H was spud on October 14, 2011 by Extreme 18. A 13 %\u201d hole was drilled with\nfresh water to 2,133\u2019 and cased with 9 %\" casing cemented to surface. A Hughes 8 %\u201d PDC bit\nwas used to drill the first part of the vertical. This assembly was tripped out for a new bit and\nmotor at 9,366\u2019. Gamma was also picked up at this time. The second assembly was also a\nHughes PDC bit. The vertical was drilled in 119.5 hrs. Diesel invert drilling fluid with a target\nweight of 10.0 ppg was used to drill the vertical hole.\nRyan Drilling Technologies and Solutions provided the personnel and equipment for the\nmeasurement while drilling (MWD) services as well as the night directional driller. Directional\ndrilling was supervised by the company men during the day. Throughout this project, steering\ndecisions were made through a combined effort of the directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst\nSUNBURST \u2014\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\nConsulting contractors, assisted by continual communication. A Security FXD55M PDC was used\nat a kick-off point (KOP) of 10,286\u2019. After drilling the curve in 19.5 hours, intermediate casing was\nset at 10,952 measured depth (MD),\nOnce casing was set lateral operations began. Two assemblies were used to drill the lateral both\nutilizing Hughes DPSOSFX PDC bits in front of Ryan motors. The first assembly was replaced at\n11,044\u2019 after an MWD tool failure. This assembly drilled 62\u2019 in 1 hour. Following the trip in for the\nMWD failure the rig experienced difficulties with the draw works. Parts were shipped for repair\nand Sunburst Geologists were placed on stand bye until the parts returned. This cost ten days of\nrig downtime and an extra day on top of that to trip for a new BHA. The second assembly\nsuccessfully reached TD drilling 9,806\u2019 in 168 hrs.

Drilling\nParameters such as depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas were broadcast on location\nthrough Pason\u2019s electronic data recorder system. The gas was linked from Sunburst's digital gas\nchromatograph. Hydrocarbon constituents (C;-C,) are expressed in part-per-million\nconcentrations. The chromatograph is fed by 1/4\u201d polyflow from an agitation system set up at the\nshakers. Under the instruction of Sunburst geologists, rig crews collected lagged samples in 30\u00b0\nintervals. Intermediate samples were also collected during intervals requiring extra scrutiny. Rock\ncuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for\ndetailed lithologic descriptions see appendix). Cuttings were sent to SM Energy and the North\nDakota Geological Survey. Along with sample lithology, MWD gamma ray data and rate of\npenetration (ROP) were used to assist in landing the curve as well as steer through the lateral\nLithology and Hydrocarbon Show\nSample analysis began at 8,340\u2019 MD in the Charles Formation (Mississippian Madison Group].\nSamples were interbedded salt, anhydrite, and limestone. No gas or oil shows were observed.\nThe Base of the Last Salt was logged at 9,226' TVD -7,099' SS. The Ratcliffe interval was logged\nat 9,286\u2019 TVD -7,159' SS based on returns of limestone with trace algal material and traces of\nanhydrite. The Ratcliffe interval had one gas show of 24.8 units.\nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,446\u2019 TVD -7,319'\nSS. Typical lithologies were tan to light brown and grayish brown, occasional dark brown,\nmicrocrystalline lime mudstone and wackestone with minor interbedded anhydrite. Several gas\nshows were recorded in the Mission Canyon from 30 to 70 units increasing with depth.\nIntermittent traces of spotty brown oil staining were observed in samples. Background gas held\nfrom 20-40 units.\nThe Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 10,018\u2019 TVD -\n7,891' SS. This interval contained brown to tan, white to off white argillaceous lime mudstone and\nwackestone. This facies was microcrystalline and earthy in texture, with varying amounts of\npyrite. Background gas increased throughout the vertical from 25 to 40+ units depleting to 20+\nunits after the trip for curve assembly. At a measured depth of 10,598\u2019 a possible fracture greatly\nincreased background gas to 100+ units. Another possible fracture at 10,836\u2019 near the top of\nScallion interval raised background gas 800+ units with shows as high as 2,271 units, trace\namounts of spotty brown oil stain were observed.\nSUNBURST ~\nCONSULTING\n\u2014& GEOLOGY SERVICE\nThe top of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian-Devonian] was logged at 10,712\u2019 TVD -8,585' SS\nwith sample returns of black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale typical of the Upper Shale\nMember and characterized by very high gamma (255+ api) and elevated background gas of 800-\n1,500 units.\nThe Middle Bakken was logged at 10,728\u2019 TVD, -8,601' SS. Near the completion of curve\noperations, below the Upper Bakken Shale and above the target zone, a medium to light gray\nbrown siltstone was observed with interbedded limestone. It was described as, blocky, earthy,\nwith common amounts of pyrite. Beneath the siltstone, the samples were medium to light gray\nwith common white to off white. They were fine grained, friable, sub angular, and calcite\ncemented. Samples also contained varying amounts of pyrite and oil staining. Oil staining was\nmost prevalent in this zone often increasing from spotty to even oil staining. Gas values often\nincreased in the upper portion of the preferred porosity. These samples correlated with a ratty\ngamma signature ranging from 65-80 api counts.\nThe center of the preferred porosity zone was marked by lower gamma values as low as 40 api\nthat typically correlated with cleaner and more calcareous samples. This zone ranged from 3-5\u2019\nthick. Often these samples contained lesser amounts of pyrite. In the lower half of target samples\nwere light to medium brown and gray samples typically containing /ess oil staining. At the base of\ntarget was a \u201cratty\u201d cool signature which ranged from 45-60 api that was attributed to stringers of\ncleaner, heavily calcite-cemented sandstone. Below the target interval drill cuttings observed\nshowed diminished oil staining and were darker in color. Gamma counts increased as the well\nbore dropped in formation correlating with the darker coloring of silty sandstone.\nPerhaps the most perplexing portion of the well was at 15,000\u2019. The wellbore traveled from\ngamma and samples that correlated with being below the preferred porosity to gamma values\nand samples that were indicative of being in the upper half of target. In this transition the cool\n\u201cratty\u201d gamma just above the base of target was likely faulted out.\nGas values increased from below 300 units until 12,582' where a possible fracture increased gas\nvalues to 300+ units. Around 15,000\u2019 gas values began to greatly increase to 500-800 units with\nshows as high as 1,200+ units. This is likely through a combined effort of being higher in the\npreferred porosity and the possible and subsequent fracture seen at 15,000\u2019. After 16,200\u2019 the\nwellbore began to drop in formation and as a result gas values fell back to 500-800 units with few\ngas shows reaching 1,000+ units.\nFrom 17,220\u2019 to TD samples were compromised as a result of large amounts of lubricant used.\nFigure 3 and 4.

Favorable drilling speeds allowed the wellbore to rotate at 120+ ft/hr and a gentle\nupward rotation minimized the need to slide. The cool gamma at the center of target and the ratty\nSUNBURST\nCONSULTING\nA GEOLOGY SERVICE\ngamma at the base of target were difficult to drill and often the wellbore deflected when coming\ninto these areas. This made slides more frequent within the preferred porosity. Underneath the\npreferred porosity this deflection often was anticipated and allowed for smaller slides to keep the\nwellbore tracking with dip. Geo-steering was successful in maintaining well bore exposure to the\nMiddle Bakken 100% of the lateral. The overall apparent dip was at 0.03 down.\nNBU: D\nD\nI\nI\nP\nP\nP\nP\nR\nR\nO\nO\nF\nF\nI\nI\nL\nL\nE\nE\njk \u2018nergy Company\n10870 3 ee Dabs\nOverall Dip= 0.03 Down ]\n10680 -\ntn.01\n\u2018eee Pa en 06 a rT) 80\n10700 | TM*\n10710\n10720\n)0vT(\nhtpeD\nammaG\n10730\n10740\n10750\n10760\n1070 = \u2014\u2014\nMeasured Depth\n= wetwore Mase Bakken Top Zz \u2018Top of Preferred Porosity\n\u2014Boromet Preferres Poxosty \u2014 Mase easton Base Gana\nFigure 8. Cross-sectional interpretation with dip estimates of the Dahl 15-11H borehole based upon\nlithology, MWD gamma ray, and drill rates.\nSUMMARY\nDahl 15-11H was spud on October 14, 2011. The vertical was drilled using two PDC bits in 119.5\nhrs and the curve was drilled in 19.5 hrs. The most favorable place to be in the Middle Bakken\ndue to higher oil staining, gas shows, ability to alleviate slides, and favorable drilling speeds was\njust below the preferred porosity zone. Samples contaminated with lubricant made correlations\nbased on samples difficult later in the lateral. Oil shows consisted of common to rare, spotty-even\nbrown oil stain observed in sample. The lateral was drilled in 169 hrs. One trip at 11,044\u2019 was the\nresult of a failed MWD tool. Third party personnel were put on stand-by after issues with the rig's\ndraw works caused a down time issue in excess of a week. The total depth was at 20,850\u2019 MD\non November 18, 2011 at 1:20 a.m. CST.

The\napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than\nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east\n& west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 2 & 11-T153N-R101W.\nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN WHILE DESIGNING THE FRAC\nJOB FOR THE DAHL 15-11H WELL AS TO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SM ENERGY\nLINDVIG 1-11HR WELL. Due to river adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the\nentire location. Also, a Closed Mud System may be required, although the disposal of drill cuttings is\ncontingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field Inspector. SM ENERGY\nCO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.\nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)\nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the\napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to\ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may\nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information\nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other\ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the\ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given\nimmediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,\nBismarck, via telephone.

However, the director\nmay require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the\noperation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe\ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.\nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.\nConfidential status\nYour request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is\nhereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing\non the date the well is spud.\nConfidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well\nrecords wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall\npermit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or\ncontrolled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to\nhave access at all times to any and all records of wells.

Storage tanks;\n2. Daily throughput of more than one hundred barrels of fluid per day; and\n3. Includes production equipment or load lines that are not contained within secondary containment dikes\nThe berm must be at least six inches in height, constructed of sufficiently impermeable material to provide\nemergency containment, and must be maintained until the facility is either granted a waiver or the site is\nreclaimed.\nPursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-03-49 - Within one hundred eighty days from the date the operator is notified by\nthe Commission, a perimeter berm, at least six inches in height, must be constructed of sufficiently impermeable\nmaterial to provide emergency containment and to divert surface drainage away from the site around all storage\nfacilities and production sites that include storage tanks, have a daily throughput of more than one hundred\nbarrels of fluid per day, and include production equipment or load lines that are not contained within secondary\ncontainment dikes. The Director may consider an extension of time to implement these requirements if\nconditions prevent timely construction, or modification of these requirements if other factors are present that\nprovide sufficient protection from environmental impacts.\nThis perimeter berm requirement may be modified or waived if the operator can demonstrate that other factors\nare present that provide sufficient protection from environmental impacts.

The primary target zone was 7\u00b0- 17\u2019 under the top\nof the Middle Bakken Formation. Although the entire Middle Bakken is considered a pay zone,\nthe target zone is used primarily because of its distinct gamma characteristics which are used to\nhelp directional drill the lateral. Directional and MWD services were performed by Ryan Energy\nCompany.

Ryan Energy Company\nMWD Hands: Joe Moore & Jamie Frick : Drilling Mud: Invert- straight hole and curve,\nRyan Energy Company Saltwater in the lateral\n2.0 SERVICES\n2.1 Wellsite Geology (Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.)\nGeological consulting and mudlogging started on 3/11/2012. Services provided included;\nmorning reports, sample examination, production of mud and horizontal log, geo-steering, and a\nfinal end of well report.\n2.2 Mudlogging (Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.)\n2.2.1 Sample Examination\nSamples were collected every 30\u2019 from 8450\u2019 MD to the end of the lateral at 20924\u2019 MD.\nDescriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous content, structure, texture,\nallochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Carbonate identification was\ndetermined with 10% dilute HCI, and alizarin red. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined\nusing a fluoroscope with a UV lamp.\n2.2.2 Gas Detection\nGas was logged using the Pason Total Gas System (TGAS).. The Pason TGAS is an unmanned\nsystem designed to measure the amount of gases exiting the wellbore and then calculate the lag\ntime to show the formation depth where the gases were produced. Gas samples are collected and\nanalyzed right at the shaker. The Pason TGAS works in conjuction with the Pason EDR which\ndisplays historical and current total percent pas at a specific depth or time. The Pason TGAS\nsystem also changes lag time calculations to optimize accuracy of data using five different\nformula options.\n3.0 GEOLOGY\n3.1 Formation Tops\nUphole formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in\nthe curve and lateral (Table 3.1).\nTable 3.1 Formation tops\n3.2 Lithology\nDetailed descriptions of samples logged are provided in the mudlog and horizontal log. A\ndescription of the target zone is provided below\nSLTY DOL: med- dk brn, med- dk gybrn, sme It gy, sl- mod frm, micxl, mod- v calc, mod arg, fr\nintxl por, g brn o stn; w/LS: It gy, wh, cgrxln- multi gr clus, frm- brit, sndy, 70-90% bri yell fluor,\ng immed bri bl/wh flash- mlky cut.\n3.3 Formation Dip\n3.3.1 Main Horizontal\nThe formation had an average dip of 90.41\u00b0. Dip calculations were conducted along the\nentire length of the lateral from entry into the Upper Bakken Shale at 10824\u2019 MD to TD\nof 20924\u2019 MD, using gamma ray, lithology, and anticipated structure. Dip changes can\nbe found in Table 3.2.\nTable 3.2 Formation Dip Calculations\n4.0 SHOWS\nThe hydrocarbon shows in the samples were good to very good for the whole lateral. We had\ngood sample quality until about 19950\u2019 MD when the samples started becoming saturated with\nenvirotorque. At that point, the envirotorque saturation made some of the samples difficult for\nthe geologist and mudlogger to evaluate. The geologist and mudlogger attempted to wash the\nenvirotorque from the samples using soap and citra-solve but the envirotorque could not be\nwashed away. Envirotorque use in the well caused poor sample quality and therefore the\naccuracy of sample descriptions was compromised from 19950\u2019 MD to TD of 20924\u2019 MD.\nThere was good brown oil staining in the samples while drilling the lateral. We had between 50-\n90% bright yellow hydrocarbon fluorescence. The cuts were good to very good immediate\nbright blue/white flash to milky to sometimes streaming cuts. Ronsonol was used to cut samples\nand then view under a UV fluoroscope.\n4.1 Oil Shows\nThe oil shows at the possum belly for this well were between a trace to 30% of dark to light\ngreen to yellow to brownish/green oil. The oil was more green to yellow until the addition of\nenvirotorque and then we saw more brownish/green oil in the possum belly.\n4.2 Gas Shows\nThe average range of the background gas from the casing shoe to when we began going thru the\ngas buster at 14477\u2019 MD was from 350 units to 1125 units. After we began going thru the gas\nbuster at 14477\u2019 MD, the average range of the background gas was from 150 units to 400 units.\nThe highest background gas was when we drilled near the top of the target zone from 11100\u2019\nMD to 11400\u2019 MD. The background gas was between 1000 units to 1125 units. A trip at 11024\u2019\nMD produced 3090 units of trip gas. At TD, the bottoms up gas was 323 units. After going thru\nthe gas buster, the gas flare was between 1\u2019- 6\u2019 high The mud weight for the lateral was\nbetween 9.9 to 10.1. A chart showing the cross section of the wellbore with the rop, gas, gamma\nray, oil shows and mud weight data can be found in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\nDahl Federal 2-15H North Leg Cross-Section\n$15, $10 & S3, Ti53N, Ri01W\n9,500 10,500 11,500 13,500 14,500 15,500 16,500 17,500 18,500 19,500 20,500\n10500 100000\n10510\n10520\n10530 +\n10540 t\nmw 10.1 mw40.0+\n10550 10000\n10560\n10570\n10580\n10590\n10600\n10610\n10620 -\n10630\n10640\n10650\n10660\n10670\n10680\n10690 =\n10700 =\n10710\n10720\n10730\n10740 =\n10750\neteretrerrfrerr\n+ 1000\n100\nU.

With the 7\" casing at TD, no circulation was established. The 7\" was.\nperfed in the Carrington at 10,798\" - 10,800'MD (10,650' TVD) with 8 holes. Circulation was established. The 7\" Csg\nwas cemented with 167 sx In the first stage and 689 sx of total cement in the second stage putting cmt 500' over the\ntop of the Dakota. The DV was drilled out at 9336' and the cmt across the perfs at 10,798' was drilled out. Csg was\npressure tested to 500 psi. The float collar at 10,866' was drilled out and csg cleaned out to the float shoe at 10,948\".\nA CIBP was run in and set above the shoe at 10,943\u2019. The bottom shoe jt was then perforated at 10,938'-10,936',\n10,934'-10,932', 10930'-10,928'. A CICR was set at 10,902' whereby a cmt squeeze was attempted into the\nperforations at 10,938! - 10,928', however no Injection rate Into the perfs was able to be established with a pressure\napplied of 1.1 psi/ft (6500 psi surface pressure). At this point SM Energy requests approval to drill out the CICR,\nCIBP and the float shoe. The 6' lateral will be drilled from 11,009' to an estimated TD of 21,015\".

SM Energy Company intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set\nsurface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set ata depth\npre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the\ndrilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical\nseal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of\ndrilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing\nplan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance\nwith the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAG, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings\nand time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not\nintended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with\nacreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. SM Energy Company understands\nNDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be\nfenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1), SM Energy\nCompany will plug and abandon the well and reclalm the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig\nwithin 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.\nCompany Telephone Number\nSM Energy Company (406) 869-8749 FOR STATE USE ONLY\nAmeee 74168 CO Received kL Approved\nCity State Zip Code Date\nBillings A MT _|59103-7168 (2-(4-2\u00a21/\n4.\nPE fn LC Ben Smith \u2018J Daw W TAG oh\nTitle Date Tit\nDrilling Erfgineer December 14, 2011 e\nEmail Address\nbsmith@sm-energy.com\nOil and @as Division 3>14,\nLynn D.

The\napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than\nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east &\nwest boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of SEC 3 & 10, T153N-R101W.\nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO A SHALLOW AQUIFER IN THE AREA A CLOSED MUD\nSYSTEM MAY BE REQUIRED, ALTHOUGH THE DISPOSAL OF DRILL CUTTINGS IS\nCONTINGENT UPON SITE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS TO BE DETERMINED BY AN NDIC\nFIELD INSPECTOR. A DIKE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED AROUND THE LOCATION. BE\nADVISED THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS 31-10 WELL IS WITHIN 112 FEET OF THE PROPOSED\nWELLBORE FOR THE DAHL FEDERAL 2-15H WELL, AND IS DRILLED TO THE RED RIVER\nFORMATION WITH 5.5\" CASING SET TO 13480'. PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN WHILE\nDESIGNING THE FRAC JOB FOR THE DAHL FEDERAL 2-15H WELL AS TO NOT\nADVERSELY AFFECT THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS 31-10 WELL. IN CASES WHERE A\nSPACING UNIT IS ACCESSED FROM AN OFF-SITE DRILL PAD, AN AFFIDAVIT MUST BE\nPROVIDED AFFIRMING THAT THE SURFACE OWNER OF THE PAD AGREES TO ACCEPT\nBURIAL ON THEIR PROPERTY OF THE CUTTINGS GENERATED FROM DRILLING THE\nWELL INTO AN OFFSITE SPACING UNIT. SM ENERGY CO MUST CONTACT NDIC FIELD\nINSPECTOR MARC BINNS AT 701-220-5989 PRIOR TO LOCATION CONSTRUCTION.\nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)\nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the\napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to\ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may\nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information\nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other\ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the\ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\nRANDY CARLSON\nOctober 27, 2011\nPage 2\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given\nimmediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,\nBismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,\ndrilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.\nand 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours\nor on the weekend.\nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey\ncontractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.\nSurveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director\nmay require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the\noperation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe\ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.\nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.\nConfidential status\nYour request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is\nhereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing\non the date the well is spud.\nConfidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well\nrecords wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall\npermit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or\ncontrolled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to\nhave access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect\nproducing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time\nupon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and\nshall be available only to the Commission and its staff.\nDrilling pit\nPlease be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on\nsite specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply.\nSurface casing cement\nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12\nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi\nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.\nLogs\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of\ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma\nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as\none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image\nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced\nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to\nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a\nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its\nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an\nemail sent to digitallogs@nd.gov Thank you for your cooperation.\nSincerely,\nNathaniel Erbele\nPetroleum Resource

Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting)\nINTRODUCTION\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is\nlocated approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The\nYukon 5301 41-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum\u2019s\nCamp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to\napproximately 10,335\u2019. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100\u2019 to land within the Three\nForks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southwest quarter of section 12,\nthen drilled south across section 13, to the southwest quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional\ndrilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks\nreservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.\n0\n-500\n-1000\n-1500\n-2000\n-2500\n-3000\n-3500\n-4000\n-4500\n-5000\n-5500\n-6000\n-6500\n-7000\n-7500\n-8000\n-8500\n-9000\n-9500\n-10000\n-10500\n-11000\n0001- 005- 0 005 0001 0051 0002 0052 0003 0053 0004 0054 0005 0055 0006 0056 0007 0057 0008 0058 0009 0059 00001\nW-E\nN-S\nPLAN VIEW\nOasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nYukon 5301 41-12 T\nO\nSurface: 255' FSL & 710' FWL\nSW SW Sec. 12, T153N, R101W\nMcKenzie County, ND\n13\nNote: 1,280 acre standup spacing unit\nwith 200' N/S & 500' E/W setbacks\nBottom Hole Location:\n9,858.94' S & 594.66' E\nof surface location or approx.\n941.08' FSL & 1,304.66' FWL\nSW SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W\n24\nBottom Hole Location:\n10,504.47' S & 618.46' E\nof surface location or approx.\n295.55' FSL & 1,328.46' FWL\nSE SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W\nFigure 2. Plan view of Yukon 5301 41-12T spacing unit and well path.\nOFFSET WELLS\nThe primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil\nExploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC\nAsh Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE\nSec. 11, T153N, R101W] is located approximately \u00bd of a mile west of the Yukon 5301 41-12T.\nThis well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800\u2019 true vertical depth\n(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18,\nT153N, R100W] is located approximately east north east of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. This well\nwas drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794\u2019 MD in August and September of 2012. The\nformation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum\nNorth America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were used to\nassist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the\noffset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was\nperiodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are\nincluded as an appendix to this report.\nFigure 3. Structure map of the Three Forks Top (subsea) with annotated offset wells (Oasis Petroleum).\nENGINEERING\nRyan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling\n(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel\nworked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to\nmaximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of\nthe formation.\nVertical\nThe Yukon 5301 41-12T was spud on 18 June, 2013 by Nabors B22. A 13 \u00bd\u201d hole was drilled\nwith fresh water to 2,127\u2019 and isolated with 9 \u215d\u201d J-55 casing cemented to surface. After surface\ncasing was set, the drilling fluid was changed to diesel invert with target weight of 9.6-10.2 ppg\nfor the vertical hole and 10.3-10.55 ppg for curve operations. The vertical hole was drilled from\nsurface casing with bit #2 a Security MMD55M attached to a Hunting 7/8 low speed motor. This\nassembly drilled to the KOP of 10,300\u2019 MD, drilling 8,173\u2019 in 65 hours.\nCurve\nThe 873\u2019 curve was drilled in 22.5 hours with bit #3 a Security MMD55D, attached to a 2.38\ndegree fixed National 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed\nat 11,173\u2019 MD, approximately 8\u2019 into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32#\nHCP-110 casing was set to 11,173\u2019 MD. During casing operations circulation was lost. Casing\nwas worked up and down in an attempt to restore circulation, but all efforts to restore circulation\nfailed. A wire-line truck was called in and casing was perforated at 10,820\u2019 MD. Circulation was\nrestored and casing was cemented.\nLateral\nAfter completion of curve operations, MWD tools and bit #4, a 6\u201d Security MMD64D PDC bit,\nattached to a 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor were run in the hole. This bottom\nhole assembly (BHA) drilled 2,502\u2019 in 47 hours before erratic pulses from the MWD tool caused\nit to be tripped out of hole (TOH). A new BHA consisting of bit #5 a Smith MDSI613QBPX\nPDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools were tripped\ninto the hole (TIH). This assembly drilled 2,502\u2019 in 47 hours before the MWD tool ceased\npulsing, and this BHA was TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #6 a Smith MDSI613QBPX\nPDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools were tripped\ninto the hole. This assembly drilled 3,165\u2019 in 56 hours before poor penetration rates caused it to\nbe TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #7 a Varel VM613P2 PDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable\nBaker XLLS low speed motor and the previously run MWD tools were tripped into the hole.\nThis assembly drilled to 20,573\u2019, drilling 904\u2019 in 23 hours before an encounter with the\npronghorn caused a sidetrack. The BHA was tripped back to 20,275\u2019 MD and the hole was\ntroughed, then time drilled for a sidetrack. The sidetrack was unsuccessful, consequently bit #7\nafter time drilling 5\u2019 in 21 hours was TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #8, a Smith\nMDSI613 attached to a NOV 7/8 3.8 motor along with new MWD tools was assembled and TIH\nfor sidetrack attempt #2. This sidetrack was successful; this assembly drilled 457\u2019 in 27 hours\nbefore poor penetration rates caused it to be TOH. A new BHA consisting of bit #9 a 6\u201d Security\nMMD64D PDC bit, a new 1.5\u00ba adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools\nwere tripped into the hole. This assembly drilled to TD, drilling 498\u2019 in 8.5 hours.\nTotal depth of 21,220\u2019, with a final azimuth of 175.70\u00b0 and inclination of 89.5\u00b0 was achieved at\n1550 hours CDT July 16, 2013. The resulting final vertical section was 10,522.61\u2019. The bottom\nhole location (BHL) is 10,504.47 south & 618.46' east of surface location or approximately\n295.55' FSL & 1,328.46' FWL, SE SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W. The hole was then circulated\nand reamed for completion.\nGEOLOGY\nMethods\nGeologic analysis for the Yukon 5301 41-12T was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc.\nInformation was networked through Rig-watch\u2019s electronic data recorder system. This\ninformation network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to multiple\nareas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst\u2019s digital gas detector, a total gas\nchromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon constituents (C through C )\n1 4\nwere recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas sampling was pulled through \u00bc\u201d polyflo\ntubing after agitation in Sunburst\u2019s gas trap at the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at\nthe direction of the well site geologists. Samples were collected at 30\u2019 intervals in the\nvertical/curve and 30\u2019 intervals in the lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry\nconditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see\nappendix). Cuttings were sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples,\nrate of penetration and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering\nand dip calculations.\nLithology\nFormation analysis began at 8,240\u2019 MD with a siltstone and anhydrite characteristic of the\nKibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval consisted of an earthy, red to\norange, red brown, light orange to off white, trace light brown, friable siltstone that was\nmoderately calcite cemented with an earthy texture. The Kibbey \u201cLime\u201d was logged at 8,366'\nMD 8,365' TVD (-6,246') (SS). This marker is represented by an off white anhydrite which was\nmicrocrystalline, soft, massive, and amorphous. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower\npenetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of penetration\n(ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite cap to this marker and enters the underlying\nlimestone mudstone to wackestone. This carbonate was described as a light gray light gray\nbrown, off white lime mudstone which was microcrystalline, friable, and dense with an earthy\ntexture. Samples in the lower section consisted of red to orange, red brown, light orange to off\nwhite, trace light brown, friable and blocky siltstone with calcite cement moderately cemented.\nThis facies was interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or microcrystalline anhydrite.\nThe Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, limestone\nand argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,508' MD 8,507' TVD (-\n6,338') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,214' MD 9,212' TVD (-7,093') SS as\nindicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The beds of salt within the\nCharles Formation can be identified by an increase in penetration rates and lower API gamma\ncount rates. Samples of the salt intervals were described as frosted, translucent, anhedral to\nsubhedral, with no visible porosity. Slower penetration rates were observed as the bit\nencountered sections of light brown, gray brown, gray, gray brown lime mudstone which was\nfriable to firm and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was argillaceous in part in areas\nwhere gamma API counts were elevated, and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. No visible\noil stain was noted. In areas where the penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was logged.\nThese samples were described as off white, light gray, soft, massive and amorphous. Within the\nCharles Formation at 9,126\u2019 MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite.\nThis section was approximately 12\u2019 thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster\npenetration rates and higher gamma API counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson which was\ndrilled at 9,138' MD 9,136' TVD (-7,017') SS.\nThe Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,264' MD 9,262' TVD (-7,143') SS.\nThe top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well\nbore transitioned from anhydrite to limestone mudstone. This limestone was tan to light brown,\noccasional light gray tan, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline, firm,\nwith an earthy and crystalline texture and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also noted in\ncertain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline porosity may\nhave been present\nThe Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,444' MD 9,442'\nTVD (-7,323') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was\ndescribed as light gray, light gray brown, light brown to brown, gray brown, rare off white, trace\ngray in color. The microcrystalline was predominately friable to firm, dense with an earthy to\ncrystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminated pyrite. Fossil\nfragments, along with black, dark brown algal laminations were visible in some samples\nthroughout the Mission Canyon Formation. Following connections or downtime (periods of non-\ncirculation), gas shows of 27 to 37 units were noted A trace to rare spotty light brown and dark\nbrown dead spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon\nFormation.\nFigure 4. Limestone with spotty light brown and dead dark brown oil staining from the Mission Canyon\nFormation.\nThe Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 10,003' MD\n10,001' TVD (-7,882\u2019) SS. This interval was characterized by medium to light gray, occasional\nmedium gray tan, rare dark gray, trace light gray brown, trace black gray, argillaceous lime\nmudstone which was evidenced by the elevated gamma. The lithology was further characterized\nas being microcrystalline, firm, and dense, with an earthy texture. Also present in certain areas\nwere traces of algal laminations and fossil fragments. Disseminated pyrite was also seen in the\nsamples as a trace mineral. No significant gas shows were noted in this formation.\nThe \u201cFalse Bakken\u201d [Lodgepole Formation] was drilled at 10,749' MD 10,697' TVD (-8,578')\nSS, and the Scallion limestone at 10,752' MD 10,700\u2019 TVD (-8,581') SS. Samples from the False\nBakken are typically brown, black, shale, friable, subblocky with an earthy texture. This facies is\ncalcareous, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Gas levels were slightly elevated through this\ninterval with a maximum connection gas of 748 units likely due to fracture porosity.\nThe Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,765' MD\n10,709' TVD (-8,590') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated\nbackground gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous\nshale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture. Trace minerals were observed to include\ndisseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill, representing possible fracture porosity.\nHydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 916 units.\nThe Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,793' MD 10, 724'\nTVD (-8,605') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the\ndecreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the\noverlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, light gray brown, sub-blocky, with an earthy\ntexture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also present\nwas silty sandstone which was light gray, light brown, light gray brown, friable, very fine\ngrained, well sorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular\nporosity. It was moderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular\npyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 154 units. Also observed was spotty\nlight brown spotty oil stain.\nThe Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] was reached at 10,885' MD 10,767' TVD (-8,648')\nSS. This was 6\u2019 to the Lindvig 1-11-3C. Entry into this interval was characterized by high\ngamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black\nshale is petroliferous, with an earthy texture and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace\nminerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 135\nunits with a connection gas of 158 units.\nFigure 5. Sample of gray siltstone from the Pronghorn Member.\nThe Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,917' MD 10,775' TVD\n(-8,656') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower\npenetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as a siltstone which was medium\nto dark gray, friable, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. The siltstone was\nmoderately dolomite cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this\ninterval reached a maximum of 91 units with a connection gas of 142 units.\nThe Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,995' MD 10,794' TVD (-8,675') SS.\nThe target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in the dolomitic facies in a ten foot zone\nbeginning 8 feet into the Three Forks Formation. This target zone was later revised to an 8 foot\ndrilling zone located sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was\nimplemented to avoid deflections from multiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to\ntake advantage of the low gamma primarily dolomitic facies, which proved useful for steering\ndecisions.\nFigure 6. Sample of the predominately dolomitic facies in the updated preferred drilling zone of the Three\nForks formation on left; sample of the underlying claystone on the right.\nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which was tan to light brown, occasional\nmedium brown, occasional off white to cream. Additionally this facies was friable with an earthy\ntexture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible intercrystalline\nporosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Present in varying\namounts was light gray, off white, rare light green to mint green shale which was friable to firm,\nsub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, and the\nshale contained no visible porosity.\nGas Show\nGas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during\nthe drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were\ncontinuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near\nbalance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Yukon\n5301 41-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position. Background\nconcentrations ranged from 150 to 250 units, and connection peaks of 300 to 500 units were\nobserved in the middle portion of formation while drilling in the lateral where shows were the\nbest. Trips at 13,675\u2019 MD, 16,506\u2019 MD, 19,671\u2019 MD, and 20,265\u2019 MD, yielded trip gases of\n2,256, 5,778, 6,745, and 2,423 units respectively. Chromatography of gas revealed typical\nconcentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks\ngas (Figure 7).\nFigure 7.

Profile displaying total gas, gamma ray and rate of penetration.\nGeo-steering\nGeologic structure maps of the Yukon 5301 41-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated\nformational dip to move down at approximately -0.3\u00ba initially, then reverse due to a plunging\nsyncline at about 2,500\u2019, reversing to an estimated 0.5\u00ba to 1.0\u00ba until total depth (TD) was\nreached. The Yukon 5301 41-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of a ten foot zone located\napproximately eight feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the target zone\nwas based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations. The\nprojected target landing was to be ten feet into the Three Forks and was successfully reached\nprior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity\nzones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).\nFigure 9. Type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11-3C, with initial target points on top and revised tops\non bottom.\nAs the well bore moved from the top to the bottom of the preferred drilling zone, gamma API\ncounts, collected samples, and gas were evaluated along with penetration rates to identify areas\nwithin the 10\u2019 preferred drilling zone that yielded the best potential.\nAfter exiting intermediate casing the well-bore onsite personnel attempted to steer the well-bore\ndown to the low gamma portion of the drilling zone to attempt to establish dip. After multiple\nencounters with tight streaks which moved the well-bore\u2019s inclination above 90 degrees the\ndirectional drillers were able to position the well-bore in the lower gamma area of the drilling\nzone. At this point the target zone was revised to an 8 foot drilling zone located sixteen feet into\nthe Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was implemented to avoid deflections from\nmultiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to take advantage of the low gamma\nprimarily dolomitic facies which proved useful for steering decisions. Steering decisions from\nthis point were made by using the higher gamma, of the claystone, the low gamma located in the\nmiddle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to medium gamma located\nat the top of the drilling zone.\nAt 20,573\u2019 MD while taking a check shot to determine the well-bore inclination, spiking\ndifferential pressure shut down the pumps. It was determined that the well-bore had entered the\npronghorn formation at 20,530\u2019 MD, which was causing the hole to pack off. Working the pipe\nand pumping cleared the hole enough to take a survey at 20,573\u2019 MD with a survey depth of\n20,520\u2019, which showed an inclination of 91.5\u00ba. A previous check shot at 20,535\u2019 MD and a\nsurvey depth of 20,482\u2019 showed an inclination of 90.5\u00ba; a difference of 1\u00ba change in inclination\nover 38\u2019 while rotating. This illustrates one of the problems encountered in the later portion of\nthe lateral. Despite multiple down side slides, the well-bore showed a persistent tendency to\nbuild rapidly on rotation. Onsite personnel at this time were plotting the formation inclination at\n0.61\u00ba up, which had been recently revised from a 1.12\u00ba up dip. The data from the pronghorn\nstrike when plotted with previous data determined that the formation had unexpectedly rolled\nover to a dip of 0.01. This unexpected dip change combined with the well-bores tendency to\nbuild on rotation, and the difficulty in sliding, and obtaining effective slides all contributed to the\npronghorn strike.\nSamples tended to contain a greater quantity of the tan to cream, rare off white dolomite where\ngamma values were lower, and relatively a greater quantity of the blue green gray shale where\ngamma values were higher. Samples from the claystone contained a dolomite mudstone, which\nwas gray, tan to cream, with a trace of light gray, and a trace of off white. It was very fine\ncrystalline, friable, dense, with an earthy texture. Minerals present were rare disseminated pyrite,\nalong with a trace of nodular pyrite. Also noted was possible intercrystalline porosity, and\ncommon spotty light to medium brown oil stain. Also present in samples taken from the higher\ngamma claystone facies was shale. This shale was a light gray green to light gray, pale green\nwith a trace off white. This shale was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture, along with a trace\ndisseminated pyrite. No visible oil stain was noted in the observed shale. Where the low gamma\nwas encountered in the bottom of the target interval, thin layers of dolomite contained possible\nfair to good intercrystalline porosity and common spotty light to medium brown oil staining.\nThe TD of 21,450\u2019 MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT on July 16, 2013. The well site team\nworked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the\nlateral, opening 10,225\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated\nand reamed for completion.\nSUMMARY\nThe Yukon 5301 41-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum\u2019s horizontal Three Forks\ndevelopment program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 19\ndays. The TD of 21,220\u2019 MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT July 16, 2013. The well site team\nworked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the\nlateral, opening 10,225\u2019 of potentially productive reservoir rock.\nDiesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-10.2 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.3-10.55 ppg for curve\noperations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt\nintervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.\nSamples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which was tan to light brown, occasional\nmedium brown, occasional off white to cream. Additionally this facies was friable with an earthy\ntexture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite.

The 7\" casing shoe is\nacross the hard line, but the perforations are not.\nAs a result of the likely case that there is not sufficient cement isolation across the hardline, Oasis Petroleum is\nrespectfully requesting permission to use the swellable packer configuration described above in order to achieve\nisolation prior to fracture stimulation. --. ~ ; i s l tv\\.\nCompany relephone Number\nOasis Petroleum North America LLC (281) 404-9634\nAddress\n1001 Fannin, Suite 1500 I\nCity State 'Zip Code\nHouston ..

The\napproval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than\nthe 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within\nthe 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 & 12. Tool error is not required pursuant to order\nPERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal\nof drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field\nInspector. A perimeter dike is required along the north & east sides of the location. OASIS must\ncontact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.\nForm 1 Changes & Hard Lines\nAny changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.\nThe proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The maximum legal coordinate from the well head at casing\npoint is: 150W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well\nhead is: 9952S & 150W.\nLocation Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)\nOperators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the\napproved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to\ncommence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may\nbe waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information\nnecessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other\ninformation that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the\ndrilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.\nPermit Fee & Notification\nPayment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested\nthat notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the\nOil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal\nlocation, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are\n8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a\nmessage if after hours or on the weekend.\nKaitlin Bass\nDecember 20, 2011\nPage 2\nSurvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor\nshall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys\nmust be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may\nrequire the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the\noperation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe\ndocument, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.\nSurvey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.\nReserve pit\nPlease be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on\nthis site if specific site conditions warrant.\nSurface casing cement\nTail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12\nhours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi\nbefore drilling the plug or initiating tests.\nLogs\nNDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of\ncement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma\nRay Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as\none paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image\nlogs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced\nin their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to\nfollow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a\nTIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its\nentirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5\u201d floppy diskette, a standard\nCD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov\nThank you for your cooperation.\nSincerely,\nTodd L.
